,1,"Mar 2, 2016",SeanMiller79,Bernie will be a greater president then Theodore Roosevelt!
,2,"Feb 29, 2016",TedRoughRider,Bernie is an even bigger con man than Trump.
,3,"Feb 29, 2016",slohunter1,Sanders looks like he might not make it till Tuesday. 
,4,"Feb 29, 2016",parkhaven3,"@slohunter1 He made a lot of money being a foil and had a good run. Not bad for an anachronistic, old-timey, Stalinist, soviet communist. "
,5,"Feb 29, 2016",Rx7,Col.Sanders make get some high scores..but. ..
,6,"Feb 29, 2016",markscottduchar,"I have been guilty of name calling. When you feel as strongly as I do about this up coming election civility has lost out to mean and petty name calling. Sorry. anyway, Go Trump "
,7,"Feb 29, 2016",TomDavie,@markscottduchar I wish more folks were like you. Thumbs up. 
,8,"Feb 29, 2016",Bierce,"Bernie Sanders may hold the key to the immigration issue. When he drops out, and the illegal immigrants realize that the US is not going socialist and will remain a terrible and unfair country, maybe they'll all move to Sweden, or Cuba or move back to where they came from."
,9,"Feb 29, 2016",parkhaven3,"@Bierce dopey has so hobbled the economy (just like carter) that Trump should be able to get it up and running again to unprecedented levels within a year or two. The illegals will be absorbed into the economy as workers and that will take care of most of the problem like it did under Reagan. The other thing he has to do to restore the country to health is to cut the size of government dramatically and slowly start to ween the minorities off of their government provided free stuff. This will stimulate them to get jobs and get back to being fully functioning adults in a civilized society. 

When eaglets refuse to fledge after 12+ weeks, the parents stop feeding them as much to get them to lose weight making it easier for them to fly as to make them hungry so that they have a reason to get out of the nest and begin looking for food. This is what Trump has to do. If they continue to stay in the nest the way dopey and the dims are trying to do, they will die as a sub-culture as the rest of the country moves on. "
,10,"Feb 29, 2016",Rx7,Mrs.Clinton will support them

,12,"Feb 29, 2016",FredSeattle,Time to take the gloves off Bernie.  Hit Hilliary where it hurts...... scandal after scandal after lie
,13,"Feb 29, 2016",parkhaven3,@FredSeattle He can't do that. Part of the deal to being able to run on the DNC ticket is that he agreed not to ask the horror of Babylon about any of her crimes

,15,"Feb 29, 2016",Tim709,"As reported  “Hillary Clinton and the Democrats own the African American vote.”

How can a person or party OWN the vote of a specific race of people???????

Things that make ya go HUMMMMM????"
,16,"Feb 29, 2016",parkhaven3,"@Tim709 So, the dims own the Blacks again just like they did before the civil war. Shocker!"
,17,"Feb 29, 2016",betterthanlife,@parkhaven3 @Tim709 What do you mean again? Still. 
,18,"Feb 29, 2016",parkhaven3,@betterthanlife @parkhaven3 @Tim709 You read the post. No comprendo? 
,19,"Feb 29, 2016",betterthanlife,"@parkhaven3 @betterthanlife @Tim709 Yes I did. It isn't an again thing, the only thing that has changed is the name of the master, the DNC enslaving them to the dole. 

So it isn't ""again"" it is ""still."""
,20,"Feb 29, 2016",parkhaven3,"@betterthanlife @parkhaven3 @Tim709 OK, lets look at it this way. The dims owned the Blacks physically before the GOP freed them. Now, they have let themselves become enslaved again politically in exchange for free stuff by the same dims. Before, they existed as a manual labor slave force. Now, their function is to be dim voter biobots. Either way, they are conditioned and not educated. Both ways, they are slaves to another class. A land owner class in the first case and now a communist political class. "
,21,"Feb 29, 2016",foxman63,@Tim709 I'm sure if you look into the family tree of Clinton  you'll see more on how the Clinton family owns african americans

,25,"Feb 29, 2016",parkhaven3,@betterthanlife The DNC wouldn't let him run under the dim ticket if he didn't agree to not ask about her crimes. 
,26,"Feb 29, 2016",betterthanlife,"@parkhaven3 @betterthanlife Then he doesn't deserve the nomination. Even by default, when she gets indicted. 

If he can't stand up to the DNC, how will he stand up to Assad, ISIS, or, especially, Putin?"
,27,"Feb 29, 2016",parkhaven3,"@betterthanlife @parkhaven3 Did you really think he deserved it otherwise? The guy is a self-admitted Stalinist style, old-timey, soviet communist. An anachronism in modern times. "
,28,"Feb 29, 2016",betterthanlife,"@parkhaven3 @betterthanlife No, but for some reason many Democrats do. "
,29,"Feb 29, 2016",parkhaven3,"@betterthanlife @parkhaven3 When it comes to the left, those who can't be indoctrinated get conditioned. Those who can't be conditioned compete for Darwin Awards like Trayvon, Brown and Gray. "

,32,"Feb 29, 2016",betterthanlife,"@Tim709
'“The America of my time line is a laboratory example of what can happen to democracies, what has eventually happened to all perfect democracies throughout all histories. A perfect democracy, a ‘warm body’ democracy in which every adult may vote and all votes count equally, has no internal feedback for self-correction. It depends solely on the wisdom and self-restraint of citizens… which is opposed by the folly and lack of self-restraint of other citizens. What is supposed to happen in a democracy is that each sovereign citizen will always vote in the public interest for the safety and welfare of all. But what does happen is that he votes his own self-interest as he sees it… which for the majority translates as ‘Bread and Circuses.’

‘Bread and Circuses’ is the cancer of democracy, the fatal disease for which there is no cure. Democracy often works beautifully at first. But once a state extends the franchise to every warm body, be he producer or parasite, that day marks the beginning of the end of the state. For when the plebs discover that they can vote themselves bread and circuses without limit and that the productive members of the body politic cannot stop them, they will do so, until the state bleeds to death, or in its weakened condition the state succumbs to an invader—the barbarians enter Rome.”' - Robert Heinlein"
,33,"Feb 29, 2016",LasPalmas,"The form of government in the USA is a republic, not a democracy. We elect officials that make law. In a full democracy, people vote for everything and majority wins. ""A republic for which it stands."" Trump '16!"

,35,"Feb 29, 2016",Tim709,A psychiatrist once said “ it’s not good when someone gets caught up in another persons delusions.”  Has anyone broke this news to Hillary Rotten Clinton and the rest of her loony left followers?????????

,37,"Feb 29, 2016",Tim709,"The Republican Senate, led by Mitch Mcconnell, has finally found a spine and decided to stand up to Obama and the Democrats over the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice.  I just hope the spine is made of bone and not sand."

H…fire, she ought to be president if that’s all there is to it.  Never mind the other 1,730 plus with at least 22 so highly classified they cain’t be released to anyone.

Yeah, she ought at be president alright with the mess she’s made using that email server.  She’d fit right in there with the last two or three winners we all have had."
,43,"Feb 29, 2016",Tim709,"So what! Hillary won South Carolina, big deal.  The mainstream media has been telling us for months that “Hillary Clinton and the Democrats own the African American vote.”  Look at the demographics of that state and it’s not to difficult to see why.  It’s not like it’s racist for all people of one race to vote for a candidate in order to advance one race over another, any more than it’s sexist for all persons of one gender to vote for a candidate based on gender to advance one gender over another.  No, nothing like that at all.??????????????????????? Na, wink, wink, nod, nod, Arf! Arf!  "

You can either vote for her and cast your lot with socialism/communism, or you can start a rebellion now and decide either NOT to vote, or vote for her opposition. Those are your only FREE choices."

,308,"Feb 28, 2016",urademwit,"Navy SEAL, Officer Dom Raso, had this to say about Hil.lary's story about ducking sniper fire in Bosnia:

“Only someone completely a.rro.gant, ig.no.rant and disrespectful of what happens in war could say something like that,” he concluded. “Hil.lary was willing to lie in order to take advantage of that feeling of gratitude and awe Americans have for those who serve.”"

,311,"Feb 28, 2016",MIchaelChatta,"@JHABEDANK I'm right there with you but they both keep getting votes.  Hillary gets away with so much she has to have something on everyone.  Why didn't Biden or other Democrats run? How is it that the Democrats only ran two candidates? Hillary and a really old Socialist?  The reality can not possibly be that there were no other Democrats interested in running.  If it is the case then the Party is in terrible terrible trouble.  If Hillary is really so powerful she can say who does and doesn't run, the Democratic Party and America are in really really big trouble."

Projected to win only his home state Vermont.
So at least he can stuff himself on Ben and Jerry's."

,320,"Feb 28, 2016",MichaelMullarkey,Please vote for Hillary Clinton this Tuesday March 1st
,321,"Feb 28, 2016",MIchaelChatta,"@MichaelMullarkey I wonder if she is going to provide her own servers again?  If she does that will save us a few hundred million dollars on Security and Firewalls and IT staff.  

We'll save allot of money on under securing our Ambassadors and military personnel.  Do we have to pay for the funerals or can that be left to families?

I don't think she should give back any of the money she has or will accidently take from the Chinese government back to them after the election, this time.  

She should pardon everyone who's ever violated national security or betrayed our country because it clearly really isn't an issue.  What does it matter to us now, whatever damage has been done has already been done?"
,322,"Feb 28, 2016",libsgonstpd,No!
