,1,"Mar 9, 2016",Stylist,"Regardless, Bernie Sanders supports the murder of unborn babies, and calls it a ""women's right"". Looking from the view of a Republican, Democrat or other party, babies inside the womb are alive just as babies outside the womb. Murder should never be a ""right"" of women, or men. Certainly, Government should Not be paying for the murder of unborn babies. Yet, we have Bernie Sanders running for President who supports such a horrific industry that makes billions of dollars in profit."
,2,"Mar 3, 2016",cammosutra,"Like him or hate him, Bernie has a legitimate point: How can we (the USA) ever have a strong middle class consumer based economy again like we used to when the bottom 60 percent of wage earners now only control 7% of the wealth and income? Meanwhile, the top 5 percent control 73% of the wealth and income and it is NOT trickling down. Of course, this redistribution of income was OK when Reaganomics set it in motion, but how dare anybody speak of wealth redistribution today? BTW these numbers come from a fly by night outfit called ""The Harvard Business School"" in case anyone is interested.
Bernie Sanders at least gets it. No one on the GOP side seems to have a clue."
,3,"Mar 14, 2016",indios,Huh?
,4,"Mar 3, 2016",Jmurk,"The USA isn't broke. America  can spend trillions  on wars that we should have never been in, Billions of dollars on the wasted war on drugs, Billions of dollars bailing out the rich BUT NOT ONE OF YOU fussed about all the TAX PAYER money wasted on these things that are still  going on today. "
,5,"Mar 3, 2016",jackflack1,and if everyone can go to college free..........who's picking up the tab????  Nothing is free!!!!!  It will never work!  Don't need a college degree to figure that one out! 
,6,"Mar 3, 2016",Jmurk,"@jackflack1 No one complains ever about the billions and trillions of tax payer dollars spent yearly on the failed war on drugs, the handouts that the rich get aka tax breaks."
,7,"Mar 4, 2016",Weirdoonparade,"@jackflack1 
Really? Use your brain.... Public education is already FREE until the end of high school.  What is 4 more years worth?  Better education and not graduating with crushing debt. 

Yes what a bad idea. Who neds 2 b smrt un and edukmated."

,9,"Mar 4, 2016",Weirdoonparade,"@jackflack1 
Public education is already free until t eh end of high school. 
To pay for PUBLIC college/university, Taxes have a minimal increase.    When one graduates from Free Public college they get a job and don't have to stress over crushing debt. Also, when they get those jobs they pay taxes. Where do the taxes go?
If you can't grasp this concept then maybe you should  look into getting a better education. You can always use Google."
,10,"Mar 14, 2016",ayarter,@jackflack1 An educated person would know that your statement is logically fallacious. 
,11,"Mar 2, 2016",rrondenheyer,He who robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on Paul's support.
,12,"Mar 4, 2016",Weirdoonparade,"@rrondenheyer 
So taxes to pay for programs is bad? Explain your comment. 
Generally robbing peter to pay paul is a term used for kiting cheques or using one CC to pay another. 
increasing taxes a wee bit for a better educated and healthier country seems like a no brainer. However if you are against health and education then i would assume you have no brain. "
,13,"Mar 2, 2016",adlbray,"Something maybe lost on many of the political pundits is that Bernie lost pretty bad in the southern states, due to his low name recognition with Black voters, however in the western and mid western states, he did very well. Since the majority of southern states are now done, does that mean that Hilary's upper hand has been diminished? If Bernie goes on to take more states, outside of the south then what will Hilary do? I will admit Bernie is a long shot, because of the Clinton machine, but Bernie still has time make up some ground. Also as Bernie goes forward his name recognition will continue to increase and at some point black voters and minority voters may start to look at him differently."
,14,"Mar 2, 2016",LiberalsHateWomenAndBlacks,"like the only real job sanders ever had
he is well qualified to write ablout his masturbatory practices"
,15,"Mar 2, 2016",autobug2,"In the end, it really doesn't matter what Bernie Sanders 'means' to anyone. He will be bowing out of the race within 2 weeks. He doesn't stand a chance. He was hedging all along that young votes were important for his campaign. Sure they are! He's banking on the fact that young voters don't know what a socialist is, or how they cling to communistic values! 

Not exactly what our country needs; him OR Killary! Although she's walking away from Bernie in the polls."
,16,"Mar 2, 2016",Lemming82,@autobug2 Its like you didn't even read the article. No shock there since you go straight with the name calling and don't give actual facts.
,17,"Mar 3, 2016",hymisser,"@autobug2 Suspend your judgement and take in what Sanders is really saying. Communism has nothing to do with socialism. It's only the corrupt main stream media that have tried to link the two together to discredit Sanders. Why would they do that? Because he will reign in the bankers, corporate thieves that avoid taxes, and create a more equitable system of economic and social justice. 

So please don't be fooled by the corporate agenda that has successfully lied to us."
,18,"Mar 2, 2016",Jim2321,Socialism means the end of middle class . it reel is that easy 
,19,"Mar 2, 2016",Lemming82,"@Jim2321 First off, the middle class is already shrinking because of the policies in place right now. Secondly, his policies are pushing for the return of the middle class. But don't actually read into his policies, just regurgitate the same garbage talk that you keep hearing. Everyone else will continue to actually research and make informed decisions."
,20,"Mar 3, 2016",hymisser,"@Jim2321 You have it backwards. Corporate control of America is destroying the middle class with their slave wages, outsourcing of jobs with tax breaks, austerity programs on the struggling cities, profitable wars, and tax havens."
,21,"Mar 3, 2016",spockrhp,"@hymisser @Jim2321 -- fellas -- you need to READ some economics before you prescribe solutions.  So far, you're completely off base as to the causes of our current economic malaise and thus your proposals are as futile as Bernie's.

Government control of the economy has an unblemished 3500 year history of failure.  You need to consider that and figure out exactly why your proposed methods will succeed when all others have foundered on the rocks of human behavior.  GL -- I don't think you can do it."
,22,"Mar 5, 2016",JesseCorder,@spockrhp @hymisser @Jim2321 Because reinstating the tax code from the 1950's will not reinstate the economic prosperity of the 1950's. They have nothing to do with each other.
,23,"Mar 3, 2016",cammosutra,"@Jim2321  Actually Jim, 40 plus years of trickle down economics has hurt the middle class badly. Do you honestly think we can have a healthy middle class based economy when the bottom 60% of wage earners now only control 7% of the nation's wealth and income? It didn't used to be this way 40 years ago, and the wealthy did just fine."
,24,"Mar 2, 2016",TUCS,"STEAL from the successful workers and give to the slackers in order to create the mythical Utopia............sorry folks, it has never worked, it is not working, it will never work..............it's just a vote-getter for rich liberals who hate themselves and hate America."
,25,"Mar 2, 2016",LvLupLife,@TUCS  I worked hard as a Marine Iraq Vet and work hard as a proud VA employee continuing to serve my fellow brothers and sisters of war....do you consider me a slacker cause I support Bernie Sanders????

,29,"Mar 2, 2016",Rolandw1,"As for Socialism it should be ABOLISHED NOW!

I'm tired of paying taxes from my two jobs for roads and police and fireman.
I don't drink water so why do I need to pay to have someone check it for lead.

,54,"Mar 2, 2016",MrSoundByte,@LiberalsHateWomenAndBlacks Canadian Health care ranks about the same as America's VA medical system. Perhaps a little less!
,55,"Mar 2, 2016",parkhaven3,"@MrSoundByte @LiberalsHateWomenAndBlacks That depends. If you are a member of the medical profession or have a high rank, the VA is a very good health care system. The drug benefit is better than the private sector in most cases.

The Canadian system sucks. Many people die each year because they ration care. "

,84,"Mar 2, 2016",parkhaven3,@ichbinerbrechen Democratic socialism is an oxymoron. The last thing socialist/communist societies are is democratic. 
,85,"Mar 2, 2016",ichbinerbrechen,"@parkhaven3 @ichbinerbrechen well, there's never been such a society based on the Marx/Engels paradigm. But according to Marx, true communism is a dictatorship of the proletariat. The workers own the means of production and run it in the interests of the workers, in order to subvert the class oppressions of the bourgeoisie. "
,86,"Mar 2, 2016",frylock243,"@ichbinerbrechen No, Democratic Socialism is just secondary socialism. You get it from two ends there. The man who decides to raise cows in Democratic Socialism must still invest his own capital into buying them and the means to raise them, but after that, the government regulates his business so tightly that the government may as well own and run the business. And, after he sells and makes his profit, the government taxes away the lion's share (i.e. most of it) in order to redistribute the wealth as IT sees fit rather than letting the actual business owner realize most of the reward for taking the risk of being the owner.
What Democratic Socialism really ends up being is something along the lines of Mussolini's fascism, and if you study it, Mussolini did refer to his brand of fascism interchangeably with socialism."
,87,"Mar 2, 2016",Nova46,"Up here in Canada, we have a far more socialized system of government than in the US, and according to the latest research, the Canadian middle class is the most affluent in the world.  Yes, Canada's middle class is richer than the American middle class.  And this is with universal healthcare (socialized medicine), and a much stronger social safety net (entitlements) than the US.  Our public education system does a better job of educating our students according to international tests;  as well, our schools provide more equitable outcomes for students from higher and lower economic backgrounds. We have virtually no charter schools.

The Scandinavian countries that practice Sanders-style socialism have healthy economies and just as important, healthy and equitable societies.  The Danes are the happiest people on earth.

I do not understand why so many Americans fear socialism - it's just a way of running a country that believes that the greater good for all is more important than the potential for the very few to get obscenely rich."

Marx predicted that unrestrained capitalism would inevitably  result in a bi-polar society, with a massive underclass laboring at the whim of a wealthy few.   Over the 20th century, America proved Marx wrong by creating a powerful middle class and preventing the over-concentration of wealth in the hands of an oligarchy.  Through a combination of unionized labor,  accessible education, and government programming, the middle class grew, helped by any American geography that produced far more food than is needed.

Unfortunately, conservatives worked hard and long to undermine a highly successful system,  attacking education, undermining unions, and eviscerating government programs.  What we see today is pretty much what Marx predicted, an unsustainable concentration of wealth and a bi-polar society.   A rational mixture of capitalism and socialism is far superior, for almost everyone, than unrestrained capitalism."

,229,"Mar 1, 2016",DissidentAggressor,"Five Ways Socialism Destroys

1) It kills economic growth:Socialism strangles economic growth in the crib by penalizing success and rewarding failure. When you loot the successful people in a society to give it to the less successful, you quite naturally reduce the number of successful people and encourage more people to fail.

2) It stifles free speech: Why are most schools, papers, and colleges run by liberals in the United States? Why do liberals often try to disrupt conservative speakers on college campuses? 

3) It leads to an increasingly tyrannical government: Freedom and socialism go together like oil and water. The more socialism you have, the less freedom you will have because socialism can't survive if people are free to choose whether they want socialism or not.

4) It creates strife and division: Socialism is all about turning people against each other. It has to be. After all, if you believe in controlling people's lives, the people who don't wish to be controlled need to be vilified. If you believe in confiscating the wealth of successful people who won't give it up willingly, then others must be convinced they're terrible human beings who deserve to be punished. 

5) Socialists believe the ends justify the means: For a socialist, the overriding concern is always promoting socialism; so process, rules and regulation mean different things for different people.  A law broken by a Democrat and a Republican may be treated very differently by the papers, the courts, and even the Department of Justice. "

,233,"Mar 1, 2016",mwbailey,"The problem with Democratic Socialism lies in the implementation.  Socialists, based on past performance, do not understand the law of unintended consequences.  The Great Society of LBJ lead to the breakdown of the family structure in the impoverished classes, black and white, it was meant to help.  FDR's focus on social justice and equality did not solve the problems he faced.  They were solved by the demands placed on the United States in WW II, which put women and blacks in the workplace in unprecedented numbers.  Even then, bigotry and prejudice ruled much of our country.  The armed forces were not integrated, despite the demonstrated abilities of colored service men, until Harry Truman did it by Presidential edict, after the war was over.
Unregulated capitalism has many faults.  So has crony capitalism.  But the economic system the United States has followed for the last 100 years made possible a better life for everyone in this country.  Our poor live better than the middle class of many nations.  We were the arsenal of democracy in WW II and then helped rebuild Europe afterwards.  As a nation and as a people, we have more options, more benefits and more freedom than virtually anyone else in the world.
Our system is not perfect, not even near perfect, but like democracy (or more properly a democratic republic) it is the worst system, except for all the other systems tried so far."

The truth is socialism is tied to Marxism and Communism because it is the fundamental thinking that eventually leads to a Communistic ruling class where there is no right to speak out against - no redress of govenment. Mike Harrington is an agent of change that brought a false promise.
The Founding Fathers, especially Jefferson, was influenced by colonial preachers of the Christian faith. If you don't believe it, check out the speech President Calvin Coolidge gave about the Declaration of Independence. The Constitution stands on these same principles of faith. How is it a country less than 200 years old get a man on the moon? A thousand years earlier vikings can to the New World on wooden sailing ships the same technology the Founders arrived to the New World in. Only a spiritual act could have made this possible. But those who love humanism are reluctant to leave socialism as they see failed, many times over, policies as their source for happiness.
