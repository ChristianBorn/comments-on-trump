,1,"Mar 4, 2016",cammosutra,"Like him or hate him, Bernie has a legitimate point: How can we (the USA) ever have a strong middle class consumer based economy again like we used to when the bottom 60 percent of wage earners now only control 7% of the wealth and income? Meanwhile, the top 5 percent control 73% of the wealth and income and it is NOT trickling down. Of course, this redistribution of income was OK when Reaganomics set it in motion, but how dare anybody speak of wealth redistribution today? BTW these numbers come from a fly by night outfit called ""The Harvard Business School"" in case anyone is interested.
Bernie Sanders at least gets it. No one on the GOP side seems to have a clue."
,2,"Mar 4, 2016",truthavenged,@cammosutra Having a point and a cogent plan for implementing it are 2 different animals.
,3,"Mar 3, 2016",William Halterman,"When Obama made it impossible for her to win, she continued to campaign.  You will not silence my vote.  I do not subscribe to your establishment-ism."
,4,"Mar 3, 2016",RickMcDaniel,"Hillary was set in stone, in 2008. Everyone knew the Dems would shove her down the throat of the voters."
,5,"Mar 2, 2016",enapel,Clearly Mr. Sanders is part of the establishment after a lifetime in politics.  All of his rhetoric doesn't change the fact that he just is using another angle.  The Clinton nomination is rigged and has been from the start.  It has nothing to do with the popular vote.  She needs to be in the brig.
,6,"Mar 3, 2016",fauxsucks,"@enapel Clearly he is against the establishment, because he is not a 1% like the other politicians. "
,7,"Mar 2, 2016",JRWeed,"Apparently, the demographic that loves Bernie was even too lazy to get out and vote.

If only someone would have done it for them.

Like everything else."
,8,"Mar 2, 2016",KirstyL,@JRWeed I would have voted if I lived in the USA
,9,"Mar 3, 2016",William Halterman,"@JRWeed Get over yourself, no one voted?  Hillary was expected to stomp him in every single state, and yet he won some states and even stomped her in important democratic states.  Unreal.  I don't want your money, I worked for mine. "
,10,"Mar 2, 2016",Syrinx,"A Bernie campaign was a lost cause before he even declared his candidacy.
The whole thing was rigged from the beginning to get the nomination to Hillary.
Bernie running just gives the DNC cover to make it look like it was a contest."
,11,"Mar 2, 2016",Sonsofliberty7676,"@Syrinx  fortunately it means she's not battle tested-

whereas TRUMP is very much so-

with 2 of the worst weeks still to come!

Hang tough for TRUMP!"
,12,"Mar 2, 2016",MOKC,"Bernie won in three States that could give electoral college delegates in the fall.  Hillary won two the Democratic can win in the fall.
What difference does it make for Hillary to win Texas, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, and Tennessee."
,13,"Mar 2, 2016",phebes,"@MOKC  um, a whole lot of delegates?"
,14,"Mar 2, 2016",William Halterman,"Bill was in MA yesterday, illegally electioneering in front of the voting stations.  He, and his secret service, denied voters entry for hours at a time.  If you think this did not have an impact on the outcome, you are wrong.

Sanders trails by a mere ~3%, and only ~21% of the delegates have been awarded so far.  It is far from over."
,15,"Mar 2, 2016",richard1939,"I wonder if all those young voters that love Bernie so much, will come out to vote for Hildabeast after she steals the primary from him!"
,16,"Mar 2, 2016",CodyCrawford,"@richard1939 As a Bernie supporter I can confirm, no. "
,17,"Mar 3, 2016",JimBerry2016,"@CodyCrawford @richard1939 As a Bernie supporter I can confirm, yes."
,18,"Apr 24, 2016",ABJackson,"@richard1939  Not sure I would qualify as ""young"" at 43, but I'm Bernie or Bust.  If he doesn't win the nomination, I will still vote, but never for Hillary- even if Bernie or Warren were VP. A vote for Hillary would be a vote for someone I find ethically repugnant. It would also be an acquiescence to the DNC and the establishment at large. I would write-in Bernie or vote for Jill Stein of the Green Party. "
,19,"Mar 2, 2016",THallVP,"There's another ""vote"" that may affect the Democrat nomination process.  It comes from either a Federal preosecutoir or a Grand Jury!"
,20,"Mar 2, 2016",kg14051,"I don't vote Democrat because their message doesn't appeal to me.  I put myself through college working full time while taking 16-18 credit hours per semester, which allowed me to graduate with only $5k in student loans, which I handily paid back working my $100k/year job in my degree field (hint: NOT a philosophy degree).

But I can see why people who have never done anything with their lives would vote for Hillary or Bernie.  The promise of free stuff without any effort appeals to the most base desires of human nature."
,21,"Mar 2, 2016",PhilipReingart,"I put myself through college + grad school with loans...almost 300K of them. My guarantor for the govt (Thank you George W Bush). I will make good on paying back all the loans + interest. Everyone wins.
The govt should sponsor young and intelligent students until they can get on their feet. Good job making it on your own, but grad school is impossible to pay for on your own."
,22,"Mar 3, 2016",Rich D,"@PhilipReingart Eleven years of college, and I never took out a loan. The government (me) is not responsible for lending money to students, especially for dead-end degrees like those that contain the word ""studies."""
,23,"Mar 3, 2016",JimBerry2016,@Rich D @PhilipReingart Well I'm glad 1970 politics and the education system that we had back then worked for you. It's just not that easy anymore!
,24,"Mar 2, 2016",moot1,@kg14051 It sounds like Republican spin that you're using as your argument. Many people with money vote for Hillary and she has a lot of powerful backers.
,25,"Mar 2, 2016",phebes,@kg14051   How long ago was that?
,26,"Mar 3, 2016",ramdom,"@kg14051 I had scholarships all the way from undergrad, grad school, postdoc, etc. My wife is a small business owner. Our income puts us in the 1% and I support the Sanders platform. The fact is that even though I've done well I feel not everyone has the same opportunities and luck and everyone who needs help deserves it.  Throughout my life, I've helped people who've competed with me, even at personal cost, because it's the right thing to do. This ""every man for himself"" concept will only lead to the extinction of humanity if we keep going this way. We're all in this together and need to work together to solve the major bottlenecks facing humanity this century.

It has nothing to with free stuff, which isn't really free since it's paid through our taxes. People work in countries with ""free"" college and health, like Canada. If the lower rungs of Maslow's hierarchy were made available to all people, then they'd be free to do what they wanted and we'd see the true entrepreneurial spirit of humanity come out. Instead of being corporate cogs benefitting a tiny elite, which is what our country is becoming. I can see how easy it is to bend the system to work in our favour so my family never has to work again and I don't think that's fair. "
,27,"Mar 2, 2016",SheepDoggs,"Thank goodness Sanders is losing. At least with Clinton its ""business as usual,"" Shes a crook but I don't expect anything to change under her. Sanders would destroy our country quickly. And especially after how many times obama used the ""executive action"" can you only imagine sanders wielding the same power? Scary."
,28,"Mar 2, 2016",axiomunbroken,"@SheepDoggs I hate his policies, but I'd rather have a believer than Hillary any day of the week."
,29,"Mar 2, 2016",SheepDoggs,"@axiomunbroken @SheepDoggs Believer??? Sanders is a communist. Sanders would take half my paycheck. Hillary business as usual (shell brag and claim to tax the rich but we all know she wont). Sanders would turn healthcare upside down, after 3 years of obama care I dont think Hillary will change a thing. She keeps saying how great it is on campaign. The debt that sanders will add to our already catastrophic deficit? No thanks. 4 more years of Obama Vomit beats 4 years of communism any day. And that speaks volumes!"
,30,"Mar 2, 2016",sb080466,@SheepDoggs @axiomunbroken  I despise Hillary but if faced with a choice between her and Sanders I will take Hillary and not look back.  Sanders must think there is a magic money tree somewhere to pay for all of his freebies. And if people think he wont take half your paycheck they are naïve. 
,31,"Mar 2, 2016",SheepDoggs,"@sb080466 @SheepDoggs @axiomunbroken I agree completely. I hate Hillary but I'm glad to see her mop the floor with Sanders. Sanders could really do some perm. damage in a short amount of time, as we learned from Obama care and all the other welfare programs, they are never scaled back once they are started but propped up indefinitely no matter how badly it fails. Both parties: after seeing Obama do whatever he desired with executive actions he set a terrible precedent, Now both sides will abuse this - just like Obama did. All the liberals heads would be exploding if a GOP President did what Obama did. Sanders should bow out, maybe someone else could step up and run. its a shame the choice the Democrats have put forth - Crook and a Communist? Disgusting."
,32,"Mar 2, 2016",b30011,@SheepDoggs Right on. Sanders would be a disaster. He'd have us exit NATO and join the Warsaw Pact.
,33,"Mar 2, 2016",AbnRanger1984,"While doing ""the math,"" it is important to include another quantity: 150—FBI agents."
,34,"Mar 2, 2016",Jiggywest,@AbnRanger1984 None of whom exist.
,35,"Mar 2, 2016",b30011,@Jiggywest @AbnRanger1984 They are reading your post and tracking down the MAC address of your computer.
,36,"Mar 2, 2016",phooie,It's pretty clear to me that Bernie was never meant to win.  The democrats just didn't want it to look like they were anointing Hillary as their one and only so someone was appointed to run against her.  If Bernie really wanted to win there is more than enough dirt on Hillary he could bring up but he never does. The majority of the democrats who support him are obviously not bright enough to realize it. 
,37,"Mar 2, 2016",axiomunbroken,@phooie The amount of competition he is presenting is unnerving to them. Don't underestimate how worried they actually are.
,38,"Mar 2, 2016",Lee112,"It seems that the race will start moving to states that are more friendly to Bernie. If he wins the vote and Hillary gets in because of super delegates, I think there will be a revolt among Bernie supporters, especially the young. Most will probably stay home in November. Some may move to the republican figuring if they can't get their first choice of free college they might at least settle for getting a job which is less likely under a Clinton presidency since that she plans to continue the policies of Obama that have failed to generate good jobs for them."
,39,"Mar 2, 2016",marind,"In other words, the DINOS and the plutocracy will do their utmost to derail the candidate the PEOPLE want: Bernie Sanders.

A vote for Clinton isn't much different than a vote for another Bush."
,40,"Mar 2, 2016",SB117,"@marind
Unfortunately, that's true."
,41,"Mar 2, 2016",MrKellogg,@marind This Super delegate business needs to be stopped. It's buying the election. 
,42,"Mar 3, 2016",Dvandal,@marind Which Bush? I don't want W.; but I would take H.W. in a heartbeat.
,43,"Mar 2, 2016",B2013,Apparently Democrats do not care about winning in November. Only Sanders is competitive or beating all Republican candidates. And he is the only candidate not likely to be on trial by then.
,44,"Mar 2, 2016",axiomunbroken,"@B2013 Right, the only candidate I'm actually worried about is Bernie, but he is a long shot. Hillary has proven to be significantly weaker than the bluster, for 9 years now."
,45,"Mar 2, 2016",crampon,"When Hillary is in jail, all the dems will wish they had not wasted their vote on a perp."
,46,"Mar 2, 2016",iski,Am i missing something or has the democratic party issued fake ID cards to 13 year olds to vote.

,49,"Mar 2, 2016",marind,@shakostarsun Exactly.
,50,"Mar 2, 2016",sendthistodave,Hillary`s big wins in RED states are meaningless - she will lose every Southern state to Trump
,51,"Mar 2, 2016",MrKellogg,@sendthistodave There are a lot of minorities in those southern states. 
,52,"Mar 2, 2016",threedaughters,I think Bernie is banking on Hillary being indicted before the convention.
,53,"Mar 2, 2016",deegeebee,"@threedaughters and I think at that point, Joe Biden steps in to 'save the day'."

,55,"Mar 2, 2016",ohright,"The math, I figure when the General Election happens, the democrats will come out and vote, with their progressive and socialist friends. Except they will vote GOP. "
,56,"Mar 2, 2016",labpackmom,"I'm still just mind blown that out of all the possible Dems, none of those who actually care about the country, have a conscience, a head for math and business, a professional persona, and some people skills, Sanders is the only challenger.  Boy if that doesn't tell ya the fix is in for her and everyone knows it.  Time for the true democrats to have a little tea party of their own?"
,57,"Mar 2, 2016",WCM320,"Alright let me explain something...
The Super Delegate in the last election cycle went with Clinton... Until It was clear that Obama was winning then they changed there vote.

That's the way it works. In sanders was winning they would go with him.
The Same Sanders cry babies that where complaining about super delegates a few weeks ago are now shouting that super delegates can win sanders the nomination.

The only thing that has struck me this years election cycle is how such a great man, who is well liked, well behaved and well meaning, and have whiny little babies as supporters. Bernie would be ashamed."
,58,"Mar 2, 2016",WCM320,Sanders is basically trying to make the left wing liberal version of the tea party... And I support him in that. But he is not going to win.
,59,"Mar 2, 2016",Remington Rolling Block Shooter,"Here's the math:  A coin flip in IOWA + card cutting in Nevada + Sanders win by 20% of NH votes/Clinton gets more NH delegates than Sanders + more Democratic convention Super Delegate votes than ""primary"" electoral votes = Disenfranchised Democratic voters.  Democratic party math adds up to, ""we can't trust the people, the party will pick out nominee.""


And this was the woman who cried something is wrong when Gore got more popular votes than Bush but Bush got more electoral college votes?  "
,60,"Mar 2, 2016",steamingpileofmitt,"The whole process of delegates and super delegates is asinine. Why should some peoples vote count more than others? Just doesnt make sense. One citizen, one vote. Add up the popular vote and call it a day"

,64,"Mar 2, 2016",WCM320,"@HappyCamper86322 There are 53 million African Americans in the United States. That's 1 in 6... I don't know how your math is, but that's not 8% of the population. And it's over 16%. And that's about a third of the Democratic Vote. I'm very sorry that you cant wright off the black vote because they don't agree with you."
,65,"Mar 2, 2016",hillary4prisonpresidentofcellblock6,hillary is a criminal not presidential.
,66,"Mar 2, 2016",Wayne Gilbert,Sanders was and always will be the sideshow for Hillary. Hillary had to appear to run against someone and win. Enter Sanders an admitted socialist making Hillary of all people look more moderate. Even Sanders was shocked at his early lead.
,67,"Mar 2, 2016",Sam Osborne,"The math establishments Democrats have not yet been able to add up

Thus far the political establishment in the Democratic Party has failed to grasp what is being jammed down the throats of those in the GOP---masses of Americans from right to left are fed up with same-O politics and are not going to take it anymore. This is evidenced by outsider Trump winning the lion’s share in Republican stronghold south (and where Trump does not win hated-establishment Cruz tallies a marginally bigger vote) where the Republican turnout is twice that of the Democrats and this being a place that Democrats are not going to be able to carry in the general election.

And where Dems may have a shot, Massachusetts, Clinton and Sanders had a virtual tie and the state had a record turnout that comes of support for Trump and Sanders and not the usually suspects. Democratic Party winnable Minnesota well reflects the reality of party establishment rejection: Sanders wins and Rubio also wins but in a state the GOP would not be expected to carry in the general election."
,68,"Mar 2, 2016",garnfarb,@Sam Osborne  Saunders is an afterthought.  He's not a democrat.  Bernie might as well be hanging in a sausage display at the market.
,69,"Mar 2, 2016",garnfarb,"Saunders never had a shot at the DNC ballot.  Even as screwed up as the DNC is, a non-democrat could never get the nod.  Misty eyed, brain dead donors to the Saunder campaign are getting taken for a one way ride.  HRC?  The latest word is Leavenworth Federal lock up is accelerating the remodeling of their conference room to accommodate Hillary's press conferences.  1800+ separate incidents of Federal law violations, so far.  And counting. "

,71,"Mar 2, 2016",matdarat,"The ONLY reason Bernie is still in has to be the DOJ. If he gets out before the convention the Dem leaders can pick anyone as a replacement. If he stays in and the""shoe"" drops how can the Dems not allow Bernie to run? I'm hoping for an October surprise..."
,72,"Mar 2, 2016",dragos111,"I keep wondering about Sanders' poll numbers.  Is he that good a candidate?  Or, is Hillary just that bad a candidate?  Bernie is not a Democrat, but a self-proclaimed Socialist.  He should be very easy to beat.  However, in a two-man race, if you hate one candidate that leaves you voting for the other guy.

I am guessing that the answer is simply that Hillary is that bad a candidate.  People are voting for Sanders simply because they hate her so badly.

Yes, Hillary is that bad a candidate.  Her general election results are going to be terrible."
,73,"Mar 2, 2016",CarpieDude,"@dragos111  No. People are voting for Sanders because his message is that of the common people. He is supported by WE, The People. Clinton has the support of banks, brokerage houses and other 1%-ers."
,74,"Mar 2, 2016",jmmr,@CarpieDude @dragos111 He is just promising more free stuff that there is no way we can afford it. Many seem so gullible that they will believe anything for more stuff.
