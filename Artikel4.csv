,2,"Mar 2, 2016",BigDoctheRock1,How was this guy EVER elected to anything !!?
,3,"Mar 2, 2016",LibertyBell2016,"Bernie said that he plans to take his fight all the way through the California primary.

He is able to raise plenty of money. So, he will be able to continue his quest of tilting at wind mills."
,4,"Mar 2, 2016",wolfen4h,"Hillary says our country never stopped being great,that's not true it stopped in 2008 and if she is elected it will continue to fail"
,5,"Mar 2, 2016",BigDoctheRock1,"@wolfen4h 


America was dropped off at the pool with the Obamas back in 2008 !!"
,6,"Mar 2, 2016",ammo17,why isn`t Hillary in prison?
,7,"Mar 2, 2016",stoneman12342002,@ammo17 Good question.
,8,"Mar 2, 2016",LibertyBell2016,@ammo17  The same reason Trump isn't in jail...they've got good lawyers.
,9,"Mar 2, 2016",GuestOoo,"Clinton will win and she is the best for the USA.
Research the following accomplishments of Hillary Clinton:
1. Hillary Clinton-led NATO bombing of Libya
2. Hillary Clinton's email 
3. Bill Clinton's presence inside a polling location in Boston on Super Tuesday
4. Paid speeches Hillary Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs and other financial institutions
5. Benghazi 
6. Dodging enemy fire in Bosnia.
7. Super Predators - Bring them to heel.
8. Bankers donating money to the Clinton Foundation."
,10,"Mar 2, 2016",stoneman12342002,"@GuestOoo Wow. She sounds just like a typical Republican, Wait for it......oh yeah. She is."
,11,"Mar 2, 2016",SSN666,His 'path' was always in doubt.   Only naive millenials do not know that the fix was in for Hillary.
,12,"Mar 2, 2016",slip66,The only way Shrillary can be walking around with that maniacal smile on her face is if she knows she's somehow safe from prosecution.  Laws simply do not apply to these people. 
,13,"Mar 2, 2016",4bennett,"@slip66 Hillary has the ""goods"" on Obama and he (and president Jarrett) know that if she goes down he goes with her.
Wonderful as it would be (and good for the country) our coven of inept money hungry,corrupt career politicians cannot let this happen as too much light might be focused upon them as well when the apple-cart is upset."
,14,"Mar 2, 2016",SamSnead,All the old hippies and their dreams of Utopia with Sanders is fading way I am glad to say.
,15,"Mar 2, 2016",stoneman12342002,@SamSnead Yes. Because an actual plan to help the middle class would be bad for America. I do not believe they let you guys vote.
,16,"Mar 2, 2016",SSN666,"@stoneman12342002 @SamSnead
If they had such an actual plan, we might be for it.  But since they do not.........

That is why 'they' 'let' us vote."
,17,"Mar 2, 2016",stoneman12342002,@SSN666 @stoneman12342002 @SamSnead He does if you actually researched it. Unfortunately Trump is the one wwith no real plan....just quotes of hate and racism. Why do they let you vote again?
,18,"Mar 2, 2016",patriotactor,"I was hoping  that the Socialist would not win. Of course he gets the young skulls full of oatmeal to vote for him.
Free college for all and you can make as much as a Dr. with your non-degree....who pays for all of that? TAXES which they will owe if they work instead of living off from US."

,21,"Mar 2, 2016",TheFoxx,"this Superdelegate thing was invented by the DNC  number of years ago so it could control the nomination - to not let an outsider enter through the front door. If not for these non-elected fatcats and washed-up former this and that, the actual people (electorate) would determine who THEIR nominee would be and Sanders would be able to continue with some modicum of a chance. What a sham. Thank goodness the RNC didn't do this.  "
,22,"Mar 2, 2016",tsb8c,"Sanders never had a chance. The Dem party leadership has coddled Clinton since day one. Add in that she has bribed/promised/threatened/etc super delegates that have nothing to do with how people actually vote, and she will be the nominee."
,23,"Mar 2, 2016",gizmom,JAIL TO THE HAG
,24,"Mar 2, 2016",sessums1,sanders is only a little more than 100 delegates behind clinton and there are several more states in play....to hear you in the media speak clinton already has the nomination

,42,"Mar 2, 2016",Goalieman64,@ThoughtAndDecency @Goalieman64 I have mixed feelings on this guy.  I am worried about him too.  He has snuggled up to the liberals to much in the past.  He constantly insults the party he is running for when he should be also focusing on the DNC.  He may do this in the future so will have to wait and see.  If he is the nominee I will vote for him.  I want to see him rip Hillary a new one
,43,"Mar 2, 2016",txpatriot13,But then again Ted Cruz has flip flopped on multiple issues just since January. And Ted supported Obamatrade/TPP.

,85,"Mar 2, 2016",Phillip Moore,@GP Russell Vote for the Mutt Clinton and put America deeper in the hole.
,86,"Mar 2, 2016",theteapar,@GP Russell more like 25 years ago.
,87,"Mar 2, 2016",Seek the Truth,"Bernie needs to turn his attention to the general election. He could win in a landslide by addressing the following:

As higher ed tuition and fees have increased at double the rate of inflation every year, on average, for more than 40 years resulting in average annual incomes needing to exceed $ 210,000 to have kept pace, commit to not providing loans or loan guarantees to any student attending a school that increases their tuition and fees more than 1% / year for the next 10 years. This would make the GOP's heads explode as Sanders chose to side with students, their families, and the taxpayers over the academic elites that have brought us this scandal.

Scrap Head Start and start over as HHS has shown Head Start to have no lasting impact. This would show the voters he will not tolerate totally failed programs just because they sound good.

Reverse the policies over the last 7 years that have led to middle class incomes declining and most of the economic improvement centered on the top 10% of wage earners and wealth holders and nearly all on the top 25% by undoing the record increases in regulations and regressive taxes. These are the people he needs to win and actually siding with them is crucial.

Eliminate the Dept. of Education which has spent many trillions as its direct contribution to a tripling of real per student spending over the last 40 years with no performance increases (and remedial reading, writing, and math being the fastest growing classes in higher ed). He should advocate that the savings from eliminating a department that has accomplished nothing be devoted to the infrastructure he and his party speak of being so important. This would gather large numbers of votes.

We are now told there are 17 million children (suddenly up from 14.5 million) that are going hungry or at risk of going hungry. This despite 18 federal needs based food programs, more at the state and local level, 450,000 churches, most of which have persistent or emergency food assistance, 1,000s of local food only charities, large charities with food assistance programs, and of course, extended families. She could leverage off this admission of failure to completely revamp our food assistance programs such that they would not leave 17 million children at risk.

Only special interests vested in the status quo of these failed programs and departments could argue against this.

These pro child, pro education, pro middle class, and pro lower income policies would propel Bernie back into the race."
,88,"Mar 2, 2016",Dante22,@Seek the Truth Wake up!  Bernie isnt a real candidate.  Its a FARCE.  Its like the Rocky movie except Bernie wont get a rematch and wont win anything except a big payoff from the Clinton Army
,89,"Mar 2, 2016",Seek the Truth,"@Dante22 @Seek the Truth  It was tongue in cheek, neither Bernie or Hillary would ever implement those pro child, pro education, pro middle class, pro lower income policies (in a caring, very caring, way)."

The voting masses in the US have become less and less analytical of candidates and have shifted to emotionally fueled identity politics as a means of choosing those for whom they vote.  To vetting of their past records; no critical dissecting of campaign promises; no critical thinking about how a candidate will have to maneuver in the current of the political landscape of the time.  American by a large and growing number act on what they want to hear and embrace policies and promises that will mostly benefit them regardless of how badly it will affect the rest of our country.

-Make the evangelical protestant version of Christianity the official religion of this country while offering to all Muslims, Hindus, Jews, Taoist, Wiccan, Atheists, and maybe even Catholics and Mormons the opportunity to “self deport”. Those who stay…we’ll be coming for you.

-Criminalize homosexuality and offering a bounty to citizens who turn in such vile creatures.
-Eliminate all taxes. labor laws and business regulations which effect the bottom line profitability of businesses including the elimination of the minimum wage laws, making unions and other collective bargaining groups illegal, elimination of OSHA and EPA standards, elimination of child labor laws and institute a Federal “At Will Employment” statute.
-Privatize Social Security. Enough said!!
-Eliminate funding for ALL entitlement programs including welfare, food stamps, and Medicaid.
-Double the size of our military for two reasons. First because we have been way too weak on the people thumbing their nose at us, and we need to teach them a lesson. Secondly, if we incorporate all the above, we will probably have a lot people upset with us so we need to defend our borders.
