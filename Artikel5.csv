,1,"Mar 12, 2016",Jim5901,"Kasich and Rubio are in the race only to try to get a brokered convention because the Washington insiders don't want Cruz or Trump.  The insiders would prefer another insider even if it's Hillary or Sanders. 
Hillary fears Cruz.
Hillary and Trump know each other very well and she knows all of Trumps weaknesses"
,2,"Mar 10, 2016",Nomuzzles,What upsets me is if they have a brokered convention who will they pick....we actually have more freedom than we used to. They used to pick candidates in smoke filled back rooms. Thankfully That's over.

,4,"Mar 12, 2016",Jim5901,"@fl2054gy  Yes, but they're voting without knowing what they are going to get.  Trumps will never commit.  Trump is never straight forward and even said you have to compromise.  Cruz won't compromise on illegal immigration or our 2nd amendment! "

DEMOCRATS then cross BACK over to vote for Hillary in the General election
HILLARY beats Trump
HILLARY gets the White House.....................................

TRUMP laughs his fat, orange face off at AMERICA , shrugs and says..........""I TOLD you I'd do ANYTHING to get what I want - and after all Folks,  DEAL IS A DEAL""

,9,"Mar 7, 2016",RWhitmer,"I've always considered myself a Republican, and accepted losses as just part of the game, but thanks to Donald Trump I now see it as a group of people whom are attempting to steal Americans votes.  I couldn't understand why when we elected people to office they seldom if ever followed through.  I now know.  Those who've won were owned by the so called Republican governing committee.  Your vote doesn't matter.  They want your money to supposedly support your candidate, but they use it where they want to.  I didn't favor Trump when this election began, I wanted Cruz.  But their actions against what the people wanted exposed their actions.  Generally Party die hards are generally chosen as delegates.  Since the seventies we haven't seen a brokered convention, and I actually didn't realized as I listened to the going on at the conventions what was happening.  Of course in those days there were often more than two running.  Today I see the party attempting to steal the citizens votes by this so called convention!  I may still vote for Cruz, but I will never again send money to the Republican Party!"
,10,"Mar 5, 2016",djw22,I have a friend in CA who is a Dem but he plans to vote Republican and vote for Donald Trump in the open primary.  Why? Because he wants Hillary to run against DT. Easier.

THEY WOULD HAVE PUT AN END TO ANY OTHER CANDIDATE A LONG TIME AGO. Maybe the pundits and the media, which can certainly influence and manipulate a large part of the electorate, don't care about our country at all. They only care about the ratings and the novelty rather than being professional and patriotic. Trump is making us the both the laughing stock and the nightmare of the world, the second of which is not because we are putting the fear of God into our enemies but also OUR FRIENDS. Stop it already!"
,12,"Mar 5, 2016",Isomerica,"The GOP (and Fox News writers) would rather fall on the sword and accept Trump's nomination (or certain third-party candidacy following a brokered convention) than allow the obvious choice: a Cruz-Rubio pairing. Cruz is more detested by the apparatchiks than Trump. Cut off nose, spite face. Despicable."
,13,"Mar 5, 2016",JimDahdl,John Kasich is the only qualified candidate to be president and THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN BEAT HILLARY CLINTON. Has everyone lost their mind??! Kasich is our only chance of beating Hillary in the general election. If he doesn't win then we are S.O.L.

they retained Cuban Citizenship.  They did NOT seek US Citizenship until AFTER Marco was born.
Thus....it is obvious...........
Marco Rubio is definately NOT a natural born citizen.....cut and dried.  No matter how you slice it.
DO NOT bend the rules in order to force a short term victory..........this sets a precedent for  terrible results in the future........

,20,"Mar 3, 2016",heishiDu,"Trump was originally a Democrat, and has a good relationship with Clinton family. In 2008 Hilary Clinton was defeated by Obama. Trump became Republican in 2009. They had a plan. At the most appropriate time, he came out for the presidency. Clearly, Hillary hopes that he is able to upset the Republican primary election, or as an independent candidate to disperse the Republican votes, in order to ensure her election. Like Perot did in 1992, that helped Clinton elected. So Trump is running for Hilary.

,21,"Mar 3, 2016",Boatsaver,"Mitt, Fox News, the US Chamber of Commerce, and hundred of lobbyist are all out to stop Trump in any way possible.  Can't have Trump or Cruz upsetting 30 yrs+ of power building around the Capitol slip away just because that's the will of the people.  Democrats are just as afraid of Sanders & Trump/Cruz.  The media is already joining in from every direction to also protect the ""Establishment""!"

Are you sure we're talking about the will of the ""people""? 

75% of Republicans are against Trump. I can't imaging that very many women in either party are for him. Every Hispanic I've met says ""Trump hates Hispanics""

Every poll shows Trump is the ONLY Republican candidate that can't win Hillary.

Who are the ones who vote for Trump? Liberals. They flock to Republican primaries to vote for Trump to make sure Hillary has the easiest candidate to beat this November. I'm sure the Democratic party probably paid Trump to run for that very reason."
,23,"Mar 3, 2016",JASONROSE,"A lot of Trump's supporters are crossover democrats. They will not be able to vote in states with ""closed"" primaries.  These states are ""winner take all"" and will go to Ted Cruz. Sorry to bust your bubble."

It is an election, not a selection. I thought the american voters decide who they want not the politicians in washington. If they fix the election to suit their selves the people will not stand for it."
,25,"Mar 3, 2016",endofthedial,"Cruz and Rubio should agree to a joint ticket and let it be known that whoever gets the most delegates will be the presidential candidate, the other the VP.. Then you drum up lots of voting for the two of them and if their combined delegates beat Trump, then their ticket wins first ballot."
,26,"Mar 3, 2016",siva405,@endofthedial This is a moot proposition. Neither of these clowns will get any significant support from the public.  Two creepy ones of the several GOP candidates.
,27,"Mar 3, 2016",spike3468,"@siva405 @endofthedial 75% of Republicans are against Trump. It is hardly a ""moot proposition"". 

As for ""creepiness"", I have never heard Trump do anything except call people names and insult them. If you really think name-calling and juvenile behavior are leadership qualities, you are in need of a strait-jacket."
,28,"Mar 3, 2016",Amati,"Bill Whalen speculate: 
""If no one is elected on the first ballot, all 2,472 delegates can vote for whomever’s name had been placed in nomination. Which means: to outwit Trump in Cleveland, stack the deck with delegates willing to bail on Trump once their commitment is over.""

What he forgets is that those voters selecting Trump will move away from the republican party, and those currently in power as senators and reps will lose their next bid for reelection; we don't want another Bush, and rather than bid for the presidency, Rubio should start looking for a job as an insurance salesman, no one will vote for this fake politician ever again. "
,29,"Mar 3, 2016",Indy65,"@Amati So, if he doesn't win, you're counting on Trump to break his word and run independently? Do you actually think he'll win?  I would wonder at the trustfulness of someone who breaks his word for his own gain. But, of course, you would say he's doing what ""We the People"" want.  Funny how your group is the only ones you consider as ""We the People"" of America and all others are un-American."
,30,"Mar 3, 2016",samfusious,"@Indy65 @Amati I would think it would be fine for someone who was forced to give their allegiance to the GOP to renege that allegiance with the way he's being treated by that same GOP.

,31,"Mar 3, 2016",spike3468,@samfusious @Indy65 @Amati I have absolutely no problem with Republicans choosing their nominee. I do have a problem with liberals choosing the Republican nominee as a way to make sure Hillary has the easiest GOP candidate to beat. This is what has been going on. 
,32,"Mar 3, 2016",spike3468,"@Amati we don't want another Bush, and rather than bid for the presidency,

Which tends to prove MY point. Most of Trump's supporters are liberals flocking in from other states to these Republican primaries to vote for Trump to make sure Hillary has the easiest GOP candidate to beat in November. These voters will then vote for Hillary.

I find it hard to believe any Republican would hate George W. Bush to the point that you and other Trump supporters do. You couldn't possibly be a Republican or even an Independent. You have to be a liberal."

,38,"Mar 3, 2016",camera1,"Go ahead. Prevent Trump's winning the nomination outright, and then pick Rubio at the convention. Trump will run on a third-party ticket and will split the conservatives, guaranteeing Clinton's election. Republicans should just give Trump the nomination.

,50,"Mar 3, 2016",dtnu2,"There's only one problem, Trump will get most votes of the 3, nobody doubts that, and when he's denied nomination, he'll say (rightfully) not fair, I run as an independent (September is the last petition deadline, Convention is in July), and it's a demolition derby from there. Because it was now clearly demonstrated that people register and go to polls in huge numbers just to vote for Trump. In Virginia which Trump won, 800,000 voted as opposed to 200,000 in 2012, droves of Democrats crossed their party line and voted for Trump in Massachusetts which has open primaries. Trump got 50%, there, next best was Kasich 18%. And finally Democrats are leaving their party outright and register as Republicans, Also in Mass. just in a few winter months 20,000 defections as reported by the head of their Election Board. It's not about parties or nice smiles, it's about our living standards. That people flock to Trump is no surprise, his campaign is geared to silent majority which suffered most while the poor got absolutely nothing while promised the blue out of the heaven, so enter living standards. And of course that will go against the pitiful Democratic ticket, which has no chance whatsoever, 8-)"
,51,"Mar 3, 2016",CraigM01,@dtnu2 But will those that voted for Trump in open primaries actually vote for Trump in the general election?  My guess is they are voting from him to ensure a liberal gets elected.  
,52,"Mar 3, 2016",dtnu2,"@CraigM01 @dtnu2 I believe that's what happened in Minnesota, because they also have open primaries but their Democrats are different, it's the most liberal state in US, and no Republican was elected there since 1972. If so, they still managed to slant the result only slightly, while in Mass. absolute debacle for others. Also I doubt people there would waste their time in droves for such a mean scheme. And my argument so nicely fits into the whole scheme of things. But you're right, it's a speculation to an extent. Still, when looking at what's happening nationwide and going into less conservative states, it's Trump all the way, there's no doubt, and polls agree, they've already been proven right, 8-)"
,53,"Mar 7, 2016",mrmic,@CraigM01 @dtnu2  I doubt that he has the best chance of winning. Those  are legit cross over voters

The pledge means nothing at this point as he can point to so many disingenuous acts by the Republican Party. With Trump running as an Independent,  the vote will be split and the Democrats win or by some miracle, an Independent Trump wins the Presidency. So the RNC needs to get behind him now, make nice, have input or they will lose in November. Not only will they lose the presidency but they will have no credible power in Congress or the House. Your reasoning might work up to the convention, but has no bearing in the general election and it is the general election not the convention which is the whole enchilada. So sit back and take another swill of brandy, you are going to need it."
,89,"Mar 3, 2016",CraigM01,@Kittery Or those that want anyone but Hillary or Bernie get behind Cruz or Rubio and the would be Hillary voters vote for Trump.  It actually could be a good thing for the Republicans if Trump went independent which is what I think is what Trump was looking to do all along.  I think he was and is using the Republican party all along to have a political stage.  That is why he has already been talking about running as an independent.  As an independent he would not have had the opportunity to debate and get all the media coverage he has had all this time.  
,90,"Mar 3, 2016",Indy65,@CraigM01 @Kittery Or the would be Hillary voters vote for a Republican because they know Trump is too dangerous and would rather vote for Cruz or Rubio and still have a country left after four years.

Some of you may remember the sheer outcry when Nixon lied about the Watergate break in.  The populace was shocked by it.  Today, that story wouldn't make page 4 of the papers.  You see, with the BB's, honor and integrity doesn't matter, only: ""The Ends Justify the Means"".  If I like your ideology, I don't care what you have done, or will do, to advance that ideology, I just want it advanced.
And this generation controls both the GOP and the Dem's.  That is why there is so much crossover between them on advancing ideology that advances their power base.

,99,"Mar 2, 2016",swchief,"Just curious. For those saying they would never vote for <insert republican candidate here>, would you vote for that candidate against the democrat candidate in the general election? If not, explain why you are ok with giving the democrat a better chance of winning."
,100,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,"@swchief  There is a mish mash once you get into the Rubio Kasich Clinton Schumer Durbin McConnell Reid Ryan Pelosi gang.  The differences shrink between them

,101,"Mar 2, 2016",swchief,"@goboss @swchief Maybe so, but I would hope a republican president would side more often with conservatives than liberals."
,102,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,"@swchief @goboss  You would, but that hasn't been the case.  That is what all the anger is about!"
,103,"Mar 2, 2016",swchief,@goboss @swchief I agree with you there.
,104,"Mar 3, 2016",ColoradosFreeSpirit,"Moving forward, the demographics favor Sanders since much of the South has already voted. He needs to win 1616 of the remaining 3037 pledged delegates for a majority, which is 53% of the remaining delegates. I don't think winning 53% of the vote is impossible given that Sanders did very well in OK, CO, and MN and pretty much tied in MA. If Sanders can win NY, OH, PA, MI, IL and CA then he has a real chance. It's not over as the mainstream media is leading us to believe..."
,105,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,"There is one more fight to be had, and it involves Ryan/McConnell vs the conservative wing of the GOP.  I expect the two of them to push Obama for a nominee so that they can ram him/her through before Trump gets the election.
We had stopped Dubya from ramming through Harriet Meirs and we're going to need to do it again with Ryan/McConnell so get ready to fight!"
,106,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,"Between 2016 and 2020 4 new appointments will be made to the Court.  That is the biggest issue of this election cycle.  Neither Trump nor Rubio talk about it because they do not want to commit to a rigid conservative for those positions.
Trump vaguely speaks of a Justice Thomas type guy and Rubio just says what he's told but Rubio would accept McConnell's, McCain Graham choice and that is very Bad News for conservatives.
Cruz will 100% ONLY support rigid constitutional conservatives for all 4 spots.  That's a game changer."
,107,"Mar 2, 2016",tombowie,"@goboss I support Cruz too, of course. I am thinking out loud."
,108,"Mar 2, 2016",WAleks,"America needs Ted Cruz! Ted Cruz has never been a democrat, didn't give the Clintons 100k, has never called for an assault weapons ban, didn't help get Pelosi elected, wasn't pro late term abortion, doesn't brag about bribing politicians, make fun of handicapped people, and Cruz actually knows the constitution. Ted Cruz didn't wake up last week and decide to be a ""conservative"". Cruz can beat Hillary Clinton. Donald can't."
,109,"Mar 2, 2016",tombowie,@WAleks Get ready for one of the greatest political fights in american history!

,111,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,@tombowie  But he won't.  Rubio has a horrendous voting record in the senate and the people of Fl despise him for it.
,112,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,"Rubio is poised once again to win nothing next week.  Kasich has a strong shot in at least 3 states and could very well pass Rubio in delegate count next week.
Kasich would love to give those who are demanding that he bow out the Big Middle One.  I predict that wil be the case next week."
,113,"Mar 2, 2016",clwyd,@goboss Kasich appears to be the only sane and mature republican candidate!
,114,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,"The North is Kasich country relative to the establishment wing of the voter base.  The South was Rubio country and he got slaughtered.  I predict that Kasich goes after Rubio on Thursday night as he has a great chance of being the ""guy"" for the establishment.

,115,"Mar 2, 2016",Kittery,@goboss I hope Kasich does blow past Rubio and ousts both Cruz and Rubio.  He could handle Trump.
,116,"Mar 2, 2016",tombowie,"I understand that many of the upcoming states will be winner-take-all, and this puts Trump in the driver’s seat. But many analysts expected Trump to win 10 states (all but Cruz’s home state of Texas) and to create an insurmountable delegate lead. That didn’t happen; not only did Trump lose four states, but he came within three percentage points of losing an additional three states (Arkansas, Vermont, Virginia). "
,117,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,"@tombowie  7 out of 11 is pretty big.  To call that anything less than a route is disingenuous.
Cruz is a very formidable candidate, and yet the best he could do was 3 states. 
Rubio is a joke at 1 state and that's because it's in the pot smoking haven of MN."
,118,"Mar 2, 2016",tombowie,@goboss @tombowie IDD. I read that after ST only 391 delegates are winner take all.
,119,"Mar 2, 2016",clwyd,Someone taking action against Trump!  Whatever it is take it!
,120,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,I suspect hat Kasich will outperform Rubio next week leading to the cash shifting to Kasich over Rubio.  By the end of next week it WILL be Rubio dropping out for Kasich.
,121,"Mar 2, 2016",tombowie,"@goboss Get real, dude."
,122,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,@tombowie @goboss  Look at the polls dude. Rubio slaughtered in Florida and Kasich could pull out a victory in Ohio.
,123,"Mar 2, 2016",tombowie,@goboss @tombowie I'm just saying he won't drop out.
,124,"Mar 2, 2016",awmitt,"@tombowie Don't be so sure of yourself there buddy, unless you're some kind of media-figure, journalist, close campaign-worker (as in Monica Lewinsky close), relative/best friend of Rubio's. Which I have a feeling you're neither of, no better yet none of those particular people within Rubio's inner-circle. Correct? So again, don't be so sure because you're talking about someone you actually don't know nothing about personally & much like the rest of the politicians since I've been born & before... what you do see of Rubio is called 10% him v.s. 90% politician-him, meaning you're seeing an illusion.

Everybody said (I'd assume & probably make a wager on the fact that you were one of these people) that Bush wouldn't drop out too in the beginning of the race, before the downfall. You were likely also in agreeance that Trump would wither away by now, like most others did. I really don't know as I'm assuming everything about you based off of the very little bit I know of you on the internet, which as we know the internet version of yourself is always slightly off from reality, it's just how it is. So my point is, if I'm wrong about you, then why couldn't you very well be just as wrong about Rubio, given we both know very little about the people we're assuming of... think about it on the busride home my friend."
,125,"Mar 2, 2016",tombowie,"@awmitt @tombowie I don't know if he'll drop out, but would be surprised if he did. I am offering my opinions based on my thoughts which get stronger by reading articles such as this one. I have no idea what's going to happen, just that Trump won't have an easy time getting to 1237."

,132,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,"The headwinds are all against Rubio even as the states move into the more liberal North.  Florida will be a massacre for him as he is disliked, and not trusted, in his own state, by his own constituents.

,133,"Mar 2, 2016",goboss,"Trump up 10% in liberal Michigan.  Just like NH, Mass, Rubio is so screwed it isn't funny.  Megyn Kelly can boast of him all night long but it isn't doing him a bit of good - hurting him in reality."

,227,"Mar 2, 2016",magenheimerdp,"Here's the real problem - the GOP ""leadership"" has failed to understand the reason behind Trump's popularity.  I am not a Trump fan given his personal attacks and such.  However, I believe the real reason behind his popularity is that mainstream America is tired of the crap going on in D.C.  Too much polarizing from both parties, the belief that discussion and compromise is a sign of weakness, etc is preventing any movement on things both parties claim they agree on (such as tax reform).  This disfunction has spilled into society and common sense no longer exists (look at all the police bashing).

Obstructionism has become too common.  Look at the headlines this last week - bill in the senate to help out the Flint Michigan water problem is being held up by Ted Cruz.  Obviously there are other senators that are involved in delaying the vote but still, people are tired of the obstructionism involving things that everyone agrees needs to be done.

Trump is playing on this.  People want to believe he is capable of making deals and getting things done with people on both sides of the isle.  Of course electing a president isn't electing an emperor so unless Congress changes their tactics chaos will continue and we'll see even stranger things in other elections.  Who knows what will happen in the elections in the House and the Senate.

It's time for the GOP ""leadership"" to realize what Trump's popularity really means - it's time to get things done, don't vilify the people you disagree with, compromise / dealing isn't a sin and start looking at mainstream America instead of leaning towards the extreme (the same goes for the DNC ""leadership"")."

Think about that a little bit. NO ONE would think that Trump could win as a third-party candidate. The Republican vote would be split between him and the GOP nominee, and Hillary would win big. SO, why do you support Trump if you think he would do something that would guarantee that Hillary would win, which would destroy America?
Furthermore, do you not see the distinct possibility that Trump has been a Democrat/Progressive stealth candidate all along? He says what you want to hear, gains enough support to get the nomination, and does so knowing all along that Hillary will beat him. Polls show him as the ONLY candidate she can beat, other than Carson. The polls have shown that same thing for months now.
Do you really trust Trump, knowing that his candidacy will likely mean that we will suffer under a Hillary presidency?
Don't you remember the last time a crazed billionaire ran for President? It was Ross Perot, and that candidacy is why BILL Clinton won that election. And many of us still believe that the Clintons persuaded Perot to run, for that reason. How hard is it to believe that Trump was recruited by his pals the Clintons?"

So why was I against Trump, I wonder.
Saying things and actually being able to get them done are two different things. But one thing is for sure: unless we actually try to get these things done, it is never going to happen. I just think it will be a lot harder to get them done than what Trump makes out. I certainly hope I am wrong, because I am tired of trying to lower ourselves to the rest of the world's standards.

If the GOP steals the nomination from a candidate who wins most of the states and has 40% of the delegates going into the convention it will surely lose as half of that 40% will stay home.  

The establishment needs to let this election play out and if Trump is the nominee back him.  If someone else beats him in getting elected delegates fine.  But playing games is silly.

The whole he cannot beat Hillary thing is silly.  In March 1980 Reagan was losing to Carter 58 to 33.  The GOP establishment hated Reagan and John Anderson a moderate Republican mounted a 3rd party.   He ended up taking more votes from Carter than Reagan.

That people are willing to overlook Trump's non-specificity, coarseness (and yes, even his hair) is proof positive. People are so fed up they don't care about those things right now. And it is NOT just the low information, ""poorly educated,"" who feel this way. To believe that is folly, and a big mistake by pundits and the establishment GOP. Just another way they show disrespect to the people they are supposed to represent and honor. Dismissing this phenomenon by attributing it merely to voter stupidity is stupidity itself. Broken promises and backroom deals that have hurt all of us are not going to be given a pass any longer. That is becoming clear. If the Republicans don't respect the majority of their own voters, they will implode. I say this as a voter who is on the fence right now. I WILL vote for whoever is the nominee, however.

Trump has never mowed a lawn, changed a tire, worried about his bills, mopped a floor, or looked for a job.
Trump has been bribing your Congressman and mine for 20 years.

Even in the unlikely event he wins, he simply will not be able to do the most egregious things he has proposed (building walls, deporting Muslims, implementing hash tariffs, etc.) because he will have little support from either party in Congress. Secretly, he really doesn't want to do these things anyway. So he will revert to what he really is - left-of-center socially, slightly right-of-center economically. Assuming he can get anything done, it may not be that bad."

Let him release all the hidden articles he has in the vaticans closet to his own people so they can see how truthful they really are. To many problems and history as it was is swept under the church rug. I'm sure that if he would review these secrets ,half the population would leave. The Catholic Church has a history of lieu get to the people. Why do they hide Cardinal Law so he can live comfortable and avoid the law .they also do away with those popes who did not comply with the ruling cardinals. They were in cahoots with the mafia washing their illegal money and no one had to be accounted for that crime. My suggestion is if they want to inject into politic then like any other business pay taxes like everyone else. The church is one of the biggest and richest organization in the world ,owning assets in every country and they still don't take care of their own but shove the problem on governments. Take care of up your poor in Syria,Africa , South America., the care bean islands a, philipines. These places are predominantly catholic,so why do you not take care of them . All you do is keep asking for more donation an have the few Higher level clergy live high on the hog. Become what God And His son preached and not follow your man made rules. You can not hide the truth anymore like in past generations .

Why is the democrat leaders threaten to cut services such as SS, Medicare etc. when the republicans attempt to stop the massive deficit spending of the democrats?

We cannot sustain or afford socialism, we will become another socialist disaster which will also lead to autocratic leadership, a dictatorship and a useless congress and non existent judiciary.  Those who refuse to vote for whoever the nominee is is giving the election and the country over to socialism!  REPUBLICANS, CONSERVATIVES, LIBERTARIANS, ALL WHO BELIEVE IN OUR CONSTITUTION, PLEASE VOTE TO STOP SOCIALISM.  We the people need to take control of the country again.  Those who think they must stop Trump, listen to the people, they are supporting him, not a party, let the people be heard, listen to them.  We are tired of politicians and non existent governing and playing games.  The fate of our country depends on the people in government listening to the people.  So instead of getting angry, support our Constitution, support our laws, demand enforcement of our laws.  We can only do this if the majority of the people speak out through the vote.  VOTE, VOTE VOTE,  for our Constitution, the liberal socialists calling themselves democrats are out to throw away our  Constitution and our Bill of Rights, for power over the people.  We will not be able to sustain the country with and other president that is bent on destroying the greatest country in the world and make a two class socialistic country, 1% have's and 99% have not's.

I was a big supporter of Ron Paul in the previous election.  The same people who are now against Trump were against Ron Paul.  They were certainly two very different types of people.  But they have one thing I common.  The establishment politicians and the MSM propaganda machine were and are against them.

I thought Ron Paul's ideas were better than Trumps and I also realize that the Media did such a hatchet job on him that they did affect the amount of support he had.  But he had quite a following.  The most charismatic aspect of Ron Paul was his message.  I thought he might have a chance.  But he did not get the nomination not because he did not have enough support or votes, but because the Republicans changed the rules at the eleventh hour.

It was then that I realized how horrible the entrenched power elite truly is.  Ron Paul never got a chance to run because of flat out dirty tricks.

So although Trump is a totally different type of personality, he too is doing really well.  Then I read this article discussing what kind of dirty tricks can be used to stop him.

I say vote for Trump.  Vote for him if for no other reason than to beat the rotten system which is the enemy of us all."

I have a major issue with how this election is being handled. And not by the antics of the candidates, but the powers that be. 

First of all, the whole premise of Superdelegates and ""unpledged"" delegates, in both parties, is offensive. Why should one individual have more electoral power than the voting base, which is the Republican party? The ""establishment"" is the people we elect to lead. There is a difference between serving as a leader and thinking you are ""special"" and should have more influence than the average American when electing a candidate.

I would definitely switch to a third party if it were offered in this case so the republican leadership BETTER think twice about playing political games."

,1871,"Mar 2, 2016",scodd,"@GlennMoore So back in the 80's you listened to Reagan promise smaller government, less taxes, and less debt. So you voted for the already senile Governor of California.
And after 8 years, you had bigger government, more taxes and a huge debt.
So what did you learn from this experience???????
Or have you learnt nothing?????????"
,1872,"Mar 2, 2016",StephanieLuigon,"@scodd @GlennMoore  And 28 years later, after 16 years of Democratic Administrations and 12 years of Republican Administrations, we have bigger government, more taxes, and an even larger debt, which you seemed to downplay in an earlier comment.  Drop the talking points and use your brain.  The single constant in this country is that ""compromise"" brings more spending and larger debt, no matter who does the spending.  I have learned that ""business as usual"" cannot continue.  The establishment in both parties assures you they have the solutions, but nothing is ever solved.  Why do you suppose this is the case?  And really, ""learnt""????????"

,1874,"Mar 2, 2016",TakingOurCountryBack,If Trump wins the delegate count going into that convention and is NOT the nominee he will run third party and the GOP will cease to exist as a viable party itself.
,1875,"Mar 2, 2016",just2sly,This is the 4th Trump put down article today Fox. You getting desperate for Hillary or Bernie?
,1876,"Mar 2, 2016",Gary713,Sounds like a great plan to turn off GOP voters and guarantee a Hillary victory in the general election.
,1877,"Mar 2, 2016",uncletrouble,"Stop Drumpf? Why?
He's doing a better job at destroying the Republican Party than anyone else since Bush!"
