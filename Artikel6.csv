,1,"Mar 10, 2016",Tommywilson,Does anyone actually read that paper?  Other than extreme Libbys that is........
,2,"Mar 9, 2016",Arealworker,NY TRASH PAPER.  
,3,"Mar 9, 2016",hazeyme2,I use the NYT for training puppy training.
,4,"Mar 7, 2016",jeff236,"The Times has rendered itself irrelevant.  Having another outlet publish a smear on a candidate using unsubstantiated rumor.  If the story is true the Times has no journalistic integrity, if not true it is just another smear. "
,5,"Mar 7, 2016",Art16,Why should media vibrate so much? Only if they are being bought off and have become untrustworthy. The new Your Times has just lost its credibility completely. I hope Trump takes the lead! I would love to watch the Times vibrate into nothing. It would serve them right.
,6,"Mar 6, 2016",FoxNuwsRTraitors,"@Conservatives. Let's stick to reality and not rewrite history.
The JFK that many of you admire cut top marginal tax rates to 70% - so JFK would no doubt be far to the left of the current Democratic party. Bernie Sanders tax plan has a 56% top marginal tax rate. Today's Conservatives would label JFK a SOCIALIST."
,7,"Mar 6, 2016",TheProfoundProfessor,"@FoxNuwsRTraitors  You don't understand economics or how wealth is CREATED.
Most ""money"" is not in the form of cash. Most ""money"" is a scribble in a ledger somewhere.
Say you put a thousand dollars in the bank. The bank loans out that money to a person with good credit. At that moment in time, your bank statement says you have a thousand dollars in the bank, but that person who took out the loan has a thousand dollars to spend. That is how money is ""created.""
If a rich person puts their money in the bank, the bank by law has to keep only 10% of it in reserve; the other 90% can get loaned out. Average people take out loans to buy big ticket items like houses and cars. Somebody has to make those items. Those employees pay income tax to the government. They get paid wages which enables them to go into the community and buy goods and services. That puts more people to work who pay taxes and buy more goods and services.
Capitalism works because it gives people an incentive to work. If you tax people at a high rate, they have no incentive to work, so in the end the government collects LESS in taxes.
0% of a $1 million dollars is zero. $20 of trillions of dollars is... a lot of money!"
,8,"Mar 6, 2016",FoxNuwsRTraitors,@TheProfoundProfessor @FoxNuwsRTraitors  So you too call JFK a SOCIALIST?
,9,"Mar 6, 2016",FoxNuwsRTraitors,"@TheProfoundProfessor @FoxNuwsRTraitors The problem is that the bank is lending the $$ to people whose incomes are dropping, so that soon we wil have another debt crisis,  Student loan debt and and a new mortgage crisis are two prime examples."
,10,"Mar 6, 2016",TheProfoundProfessor,"@FoxNuwsRTraitors  Let me give you an example. Say there is a popular singer named Britney. Britney is very talented and works very hard. People willingly pay for her records and concert tickets, and Britney has made $100 Million. How much should we tax Britney at? Most liberals I ask this question say, ""Nobody needs $100 Million! People are starving! Tax her at 50%! Tax her at 75%!""
I'll go you one better. I'll tax Britney at 100%. I'm going to take all of her $100 Million and give it to the ""poor.""
So what does Britney's $100 Million get us? Well, there are 40 million people in America right now on food stamps. $100 Million will get each of them 2 McDonald's cheeseburgers, AND THEN THE MONEY IS GONE!
By stealing all of Britney's money, we bought the nation's poor one lousy lunch.
What else happened? Can you figure out what is really evil and destructive about high taxes?
Why would Britney or anyone else ever work again? Why should they? They now know that all you are going to do is steal all the money they've made. They might as well sit on their rears and not do anything. Why work hard or invent anything if it is just going to be taken from you?
Now, if we had taxed Britney at a reasonable rate of, say, 10%, she would continue making records and selling out concerts. She would employ thousands of people either directly or indirectly. All those people would pay income taxes and have money to buy goods and services. That would put more people to work who would pay more taxes.
Under this scenario, the government actually TAKES IN MORE in taxes! It also doesn't have to spend as much on welfare entitlements because everybody is employed and producing instead of taking out of the system."
,11,"Mar 6, 2016",FoxNuwsRTraitors,"@TheProfoundProfessor @FoxNuwsRTraitors 
Right now there is proof all around us that the theory of supply-side economics - Conservative economics - Reaganomics - trickle-down economics - is complete nonsense. The supply-side theory states that if you cut taxes on the wealthy and corporations, and reduce regulations, the wealthy and corporations will invest the new cash in their pockets to produce more and the economy will grow as a result.

But right now the wealthy and corporations have record $trillion in their pockets - $8 trillion parked in US savings deposits earning near 0% and more $trillions parked in foreign countries. The failure of supply-side economics - Reaganomics - is proven by the fact that these $trillions are NOT now being invested - but in fact are growing into larger cash surpluses as tax cut windfalls are hoarded rather than invested - not even invested in the world's lowest taxed, lowest wage, and least regulated economies. Even if you buy the Conservative claim that taxes or regulations are too costly in the US, why are these $trillions being mostly hoarded when they could be invested to create new sipply elsewhere in countries with the lowest tax rates, wages, and regulations?

Obviously, there is simply no incentive for greater investment - even with the current record profit margins - because there are simply no customers to buy huge increases in production (supply) anywhere in the world - no matter where it's produced. With so much cash just sitting there - $trillions uninvested or inflating asset prices - the idea that tax cuts for the wealthy - like those in Kansas or Maine - would grow the economy is completely absurd. The best that Kansas or Maine can hope for is to use their low tax rates to steal jobs from other states - transfering unemployment and misery to those other states with America suffering a net loss as Conservatives divide America in a Race to the Bottom."
,12,"Mar 7, 2016",Art16,@FoxNuwsRTraitors Go back to your cubicle in the DNC or White House. Your propaganda speaks volumes for the job you are doing for the weak minded foolish politicians in the Democratic ranks. You remind me of Jane Fonda behind the trigger of a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft battery.

,17,"Mar 6, 2016",Toomas115,"""Under any definition of journalism ethics, anyone at the paper who leaked Trump’s off-the-record comments would be committing a serious violation.""

,18,"Mar 6, 2016",standforGOD,"wow, if they break it I wonder if Trumps lawyers can get him ownership, ha, now that would be a HOOT!"
,19,"Mar 5, 2016",pointon,"Trump has NOT reversed himself on any of his policies, but has explained them in more detail.  The New York Times is a RAG and owned by CARLOS SLIM the richest Mexican in Mexico.  He is worth $80 Billion and shares none of it with his people.

That's what they call it ""Tapped"".  EX president Vicente Fox was part of the PRI Party."
,20,"Mar 4, 2016",TheMan2011,NY Times is a scandal ridden paper with falling readership and has many false reports it has printed. It's just the organ for the Left. owned by Carlos Slim Mexican Open Borders Billionaire which explains a lot.

,22,"Mar 4, 2016",turtletank,@DustinG  Imagine how scared the corrupt would be.
,23,"Mar 4, 2016",igwt,"I just voted for Trump in my Virginia Primary.  But I am surely regretting it after hearing Trump's comments on importing talented foreign workers and hiring foreigners for his 5 month positions at his hotel.

For a ""great"" capitalist society employers do not import workers  when they have jobs that are short term and  do not attract many workers.  Those employers are supposed to offer more premium wages for those jobs -NOT IMPORT WORKERS  Japan wouldn't even import trashmen.

When you need SKILLED WORKERS in particular fields you offer MERIT based scholarships to students to study in those areas.   You do not import skilled labor from other countries.

MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN DOES NOT MEAN GUTTING THE REST OF OUR JOBS BY BRINGING IN FOREIGN WORKERS--NOR DOES IT MEAN ACCOMODATING BIG BUSINESS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE WORKER--iT MEANS BRINGING BACK OUR INDUSTRY, TRAINING OUR PEOPLE, BELIEVING--WHAT KIND OF A @#$%% THINKS AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE NOT CAPABLE OF FILLING ANY SKILLED LABOR POSITIONS WITH THE PROPER TRAINING.

TRUMP IS JUST PLANNING ON SELLING US OUT AT A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL.

i was disgusted by Romney disregarding America's voting--but as much as I would like to believe that Trump will make America great again--great for who CEOS -it already is
Edit (in 3 minutes)"
,24,"Mar 4, 2016",TheMan2011,@igwt Try hiring locals in Florida for part time seasonal jobs and you will see that it is very difficult. This type of work doesn't appeal because a lot of the demographic who would do the work would rather get unemployment and government benefits. I've interview many thousands of people for jobs in my various companies and hired over 1000 in the last 14 years and the locals turned out to be some of the worst employees. The ones from outside USA appreciated a job and most of them worked hard. They were all legal hires. Blame the laws that people like Rubio helped pass. You've obviously never been in business here.
,25,"Mar 4, 2016",blsoft,@igwt  just remember that Obama had the standards lowered at many schools & universities so more unachieving students could graduate. What do you expect.

I believe that and it's just what we want.  We don't like it as it is, so the republican voters are willing to take a chance on anyone they feel with make a drastic change.  I don't even call myself a Republican any more, I use Independent although I wouldn't vote for a Democrat after obama and now what they are offering."

,65,"Mar 3, 2016",janderl,"@Comitus @ambientnoise @burren47 Yeah, well, that's simply not true.

The 2 alternatives Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are indebted to their donors and can never negotiate a deal whether it is national or global. They cannot pull people together. They cannot add new members to the GOP as Donald Trump has demonstrated. Also Rubio has a lot of hidden secrets during his tenure as Speaker in Florida such as the house he owned in Tallahassee that was used as a brothel for his lobbyists and big donors; which he eventually sold to a lobbyist for a huge profit; plus his family ties to drug dealing.
