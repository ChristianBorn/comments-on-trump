,4,"Mar 12, 2016",Ukipaheep,"I was 16 years old when the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago turned into a full blown riot. I remember watching on TV and feeling sorry for the protestors being clubbed and tear gassed. Now, 48 years later, I watch the situation unfold in Chicago, and wish the cops WOULD club and tear gas this generation of protestors. There is a key difference between 1968 and 2016. Then, the protests were against the government and it's role in the Vietnam War. Now, the protests pit American against American in a fit of anger not seen since the Civil War. Hope we can get through this, as we eventually did in 1968, for the next generation's sake. "

,11,"Mar 11, 2016",bloviater,"Rueters; Now illegals have USA maps from Mexican government -
They wonder why we do not like millions of people strolling over our borders illegally.
First the Mexican government gives these people a nice little manual on how to sneak over the border, how to evade law enforcement officials, where the best jobs are, and how to continue avoiding detection while living here.
So naturally the next step would be to hand out maps of bordering states like Arizona and show them where the watering holes are and the best places to stop and rest up for their illegal trek across America.
Mexicans working in the United States are a huge source of revenue for Mexico, sending home more than $16 billion in money that should have been paid to Americans. Is it any wonder the Mexican government does not want reforms? Not only are they reaping the huge windfall of cash, they get to let American citizens pay for Mexicans health care, overcrowded housing, and fake social security costs. Not to mention the loss of revenue from taxes that they never pay.. Which means Mexico is thriving on illegal activity.
PLEASE KEEP AMERICAN JOBS AND PAYROLL IN AMERICA!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT"

( As if we have been conquered) ! What a disgrace this nation has become to allow that. 1/3 of Emergency rooms have been forced to close in that county due to the Mexican invasion. ( killing Americans that couldn't get help in time ) This formerly rich county has been bankrupted in the Billions (with a B) due to services the aliens are taking from it.
We cant even drive down the block without being stuck behind Mexicans driving 10 miles per hour terrified they will cause an accident with no insurance (thereby causing accidents.)

Possibly so since Cruz is also on the take from the ""Open Borders"" multi Billionaire cabal.  Granted, to a much smaller extent, but if Rubio goes down in Florida then his campaign is over. The big moneyed donor buy off would likely shift to Cruz. The nice part of that is when they do the word will get out.

,64,"Mar 9, 2016",WiseOne99,"@deathmode  What law? Espionage? Giving secrets to the enemy? There is no criminal offense in negligence in handling classified documents, otherwise half of defense contractors and all of Government officials would be in prison. If these docs were not marked, she had no way of knowing they were classified, since the do classifiers use arbitrary and illogical rules in classifying docs - the CIA classifies everything (F=ma? TS/SCI!)whereas DoD and State are much less stringent. After 40 years of handling TS/SCI and Secret documents, and seeing lots of transgressions by even highly placed individuals (they took them home, left safes open, cut markings off, briefed unauthorized personnel, openly discussed TS info outside SCIFs). I never saw anyone prosecuted for a criminal offense - they worst that ever happened is they were debriefed from a program and prevented future access, usually they were given a reprimand and told not to do it again. THERE IS NO FEDERAL LAW AGAINST NEGLIGENT HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL,UNLESS IT IS DELIBERATE PASSING CLASSIFIED INFO TO THE PRESS OR FOREIGN NATIONS."

If a school teacher received a personal video from a colleague for her fourth students to watch and she viewed it's contents as X-rated........do you think if she showed that video to her class....that the excuse....it wasn't classified as X-rated at the time I received it....would be justifiable against corruption of minor charges?

,83,"Mar 8, 2016",tom1940,"Rush was talking about a ""secret"" confab on an island off the Georgia Coast, or thereabouts, where Bill Chrystal, a number of silicon valley moguls and House and Senate Leaders, etc. Some Legislators and other (Party Insiders), were sequestered, and the main topic was:  ""How do we stop Trump?""
I have no trouble with the boys and (girls if any), getting together to plot strategy.  I do however, believe that ""conspiracies"" running against the grain of public opinion of the voters, comprised of Independents, disaffected Liberals and blue collar Conservatives that would lead us to believe that either they, (the Party Insiders and deal makers) -  (The Sequestered Folks) will derail normal proceedings, by hijacking the convention, or throwing their weight over to ensure Hillary might be the next President, (not a suggested nor implied alternative to be sure), but one, people may conclude, if the general public is kept in the dark about!  Therefore; rather then waste money, time and energy trying to stop Trump, why not support him?  He, after all, is the only candidate of those leading (save for Kasich - (although I've not heard of it being reportedly having been heard) - whom has publicly said he will meet with both Senate and House Leadership.  From that I conclude he is opening the door to beginning a dialogue.  Cruz would, but can't, because he's already closed those doors and I'm not sure they are ready to be opened.  Rubio, (In my opinion - ""Obama light""), I feel will tell 'em what they want to hear, but leave them with the feeling of needing to take a shower afterwards.  Too slick.  Too oily.  Too disingenuous to really inspire confidence in either Ryan or McConnell. Trump knows he has to deal with the Congress.  Done deal.  As a deal maker, that is the one and only way his 100 first days are ""going to happen"", and get anything done.  Beyond that, (as the Danes say - company becomes like unrefrigerated fish - it does not improve with age!).  The same for politicians with an ""agenda"", wanting to get ""stuff"" done.

,90,"Mar 8, 2016",mrbobspeaks,"I disagree.  I think Cruz still has a chance, and should stay in. Rubio and Kasich need to bow out.  Having said that, here's my take on why Trump is winning among the people:

I'm voting for Trump, not so much for Trump, but as a weapon against the establishment. We are sick of business as usual.

I'm saying we're sick of lawyer tricks where the law applies to some, but not to others... where minor offenses on the part of an unfavored candidate are more important than major offenses of their candidate.

We are sick of defamatory smears by special interests (not limited to Glen Beck, Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, etc), who know their smears are distortions of the truth, if they contain any truth at all, but say them anyway.

We are tired of an oligarchy of politicians (like the Clintons, the Bushes, and even Bernie Sanders, who has never held a private sector job in his life) who make a career in ""public service,"" but are above the laws themselves.

We're sick of politicians who know the people want term limits... have wanted term limits for a full generation now..., but contrary to the people's wishes and out of self-preservation, refuse to enact that law.

We're sick of politicians that strike bad business deals with foreign nations, hoping that in the next round, that foreign nation will grant us some sort of concession.

We're sick of spineless politicians that won't apply sanctions to foreign nations that deliberately violate trade laws, immigration laws, etc because ""it might start a trade war""... and then allow other countries to claim the US is evil for protecting our interests.

We're sick of politicians who try to micromanage business and economy with regulations and favorable tax breaks for certain industries while maintaining one of the highest business tax rates in the world for others (like coal, which powers our nation, including southern california)... and then blame other countries for making the products we can no longer afford to make under our tax and regulatory structures.

Above all, I'm saying we need someone that will kick the tables over and level the playing field for the average guy paying too much in taxes for a gov't that thrives on incompetency and inefficiency.

And finally, I'm saying that Trump is the only person that has any realistic hope of doing any of that, let alone all of it.

Can you hear us now?"
,91,"Mar 8, 2016",shegens,@mrbobspeaks Very well said. I'm voting for him for the same reasons.

That leaves him with no more than 30% of the vote at max.  The Establishment voters are those that refuse to shut the Gov't down and were all for the latest Omnibus Bill passed by Congress.  They hate Cruz more than they hate Trump.  


Regardless the IRONY of this entire race is that the TEA PARTY/Conservatives and Evangelicals has wiped out the Establishment registered Republican voter.  Now it will be up to the Establishment voter to decide who wins the race:  Trump or Cruz.  If they stay home Trump wins.  If Rubio and Kasich stay in, Trump wins.  If they somehow mobilize to take out Trump, Cruz wins.  That is extremely unlikely, given their hatred of Cruz.


Backing Cruz means permanently handing the GOP to its Conservative Base, something they have ALWAYS worked hard at avoiding.  Backing Trump means a temporary lose of power of controlling the GOP, especially if Hillary wins, than they can get the GOP back.  So at this point it would seem to benefit the Bushes to hang onto their Party by allowing Trump to get the nomination, and then help Hillary win.

,232,"Mar 4, 2016",smunions,"EXPLAIN THIS PLEASE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

United States V. Wong Kim Ark (1898), the Supreme Court said this:

“…A person born out of the jurisdiction of the United States can only become a citizen by being naturalized, either by treaty, as in the case of the annexation of foreign territory, or by authority of Congress, exercised either by declaring certain classes of persons to be citizens, as in the enactments conferring citizenship upon foreign-born children of citizens, or by enabling foreigners individually to become citizens…”

Here’s how Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, who wrote the majority opinion in the citizenship case of Afroyim v. Rusk, said it in Rogers v Bellei (1971):

“Although those Americans who acquire their citizenship under statutes conferring citizenship on the foreign-born children of citizens are not popularly thought of as naturalized citizens, the use of the word “naturalize” in this way has a considerable constitutional history. Congress is empowered by the Constitution to “establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization,” Art. I, Sec 8. Anyone acquiring citizenship solely under the exercise of this power is, Constitutionally speaking, A NATURALIZED CITIZEN.”

Here’s how Justice William O. Douglas said it in Schneider V. Rusk (1964):

“We start from the premise that the rights of citizenship of the native born and of the naturalized person are of the same dignity, and are coextensive. The only difference drawn by the Constitution is that only the “natural born” citizen is eligible to be President. Art. II, § 1.”

And in Luria v. United States, 231 U.S. 9 (1913), the Supreme Court said:

“Under our Constitution, a naturalized citizen stands on an equal footing with the native citizen in all respects save that of eligibility to the Presidency.”

Runio is a 14th Amendment naturalized citizen.

Cruz and Rubio CANNOT be a Natural Born Citizens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,233,"Mar 6, 2016",dmac8889,"@smunions Rubio is NOT a Naturalized citizen.  He was born on the soil of the US, therefore he is a citizen and also a Natural Born citizen -14th Amendment.

Basically I vote for who I feel will do the best job.  Lately I've been so disenfranchised with politics in general, I was actually considering not voting in this coming election.  Year after year, election after election, it's been the same old song and dance regardless of what party it is.  I'm  honestly sick and tired of the career politicians because it's suppose to be about ""We the People"" and it's more likely about them only looking out for ""their"" best interests instead of ours.  

Now I was really very skeptical about Trump in the beginning, but after Tuesday, I'm pretty certain he will be our next POTUS.  I'm not sure how I feel about that  yet, but I do know this....he's not a Career Politician, and for me, that's refreshing.  If he can actually do what he claims to be able to do...sit down with members of congress on both sides and bring people together for compromise, then maybe, our country has a chance. I won't vote for Hillary that much is certain.  I'm  not wiling to look the other way over her serious lack of judgement about the classified e-mails and using her own personal e-mail, when that was clearly not allowed.

Also, Cruz can't just say, ""Hey delegates, Trump gave me money, so now you have to vote for him.""  That's not how it works.  In a contested convention, delegates vote by secret ballot and can pick whoever they want.

Plenty of Republicans will refuse to vote for him if he does win.  (Did you not hear anything about #nevertrump?)
Remember that if every Republican votes Republican and every Democrat votes Democrat, it's independents and third-party members who decide the election (with Democrats having an advantage because they're more of them).  Trump is very controversial; while some sycophants love him, many people are appalled by him.  There's no middle ground.  He's not a very good candidate for a general election.
Honestly, in the case of a contested convention, if the GOP establishment went with Trump, they'd be alienating the voters who are up in the air and about 2/3 of their own party to essentially lose the election.  Considering that, I don't think anyone will say, ""Oh, hey, we better go with Trump because some guy who goes by RichardBucket wrote on the internet that he won't vote for any of our candidates ever again."""

AP reports that 40% of the absentee ballots in Florida are from never-voted-before voters.  Even Dem operatives admit that the union leadership will endorse the Dem but the rank and file are breaking towards Trump.  Some polls have Trump winning 25% of the black vote.  He is doing way better with Hispanics than Romney did on election day.  And all that BEFORE Hillary gets indicted.  And half of all conservatives already support Trump.  And those Reagan conservatives - the pre-globalism conservatives who think that globalism - million points of light - welfare to world crap is not conservative have only one candidate who will not sell them out to the world.

There are a lot of fiscal conservatives who can't stand GOP religious right-wing social issues being part of the package for government.

a non-professional politician is actually causing  a GROUND SWELL & GRASSROOTS passion in so many of us FED UP with the status quo establishment  and  even the  TEA PARTY many of us thought would make a difference with the  2010 election,  the  2012 and 2014 elections.  

NO ONE(S)  in ELECTED OFFICE seems to have had much  effect on the steamroller 'EMPEROR'  BARACK OBAMA's agenda of the  FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM AMERICA.

NO ONE(S) in DC,  seems to have had the INTESTINAL FORTITUDE to fight him and stop him during his tenure in OUR White House.  
NO ONE (S) have created a UNITED FRONT of Senators or Congressmen with proverbial  'spine of steel'  

Many of us are looking to OUTSIDER Donald Trump to bring his expertise and  his network of advisors  and  contacts who actually have  made EXECUTIVE DECISIONS,  budgets,  to find together to  STRENGTHEN AMERICA  economically,  reputation and stature worldwide,  negotiating and keep promises.   

Having our allies know they  CAN DEPEND on  the US to  be there to support them.

With all of his bluster about 'sweeping the table' and with the media's gleeful promotion of the man, he's still only 90 delegates ahead in a 1,200+ race--he underperformed and Ted outperformed. The next four primaries are closed, meaning Trump can't pull in Dems and Indies, so Ted is expected to do quite well. Looks like Ben Carson will be dropping out - majority of votes to Cruz. I'm not sure where you get off making such a pronouncement so early.
There is no longer such a thing as an 'article' in the news anymore. It's either an editorial or an outright campaign ad for a candidate, and usually Trump. I know you are hoping Trump will get the nomination because he's projected to lose to Hillary, but you'll have to get over all that. If Rubio drops out, it will be Cruz who's unstoppable--they will rally around him even if they don't care for him, just to stop Trump. Seriously, the whole premise of this article is so last week."

Trump will win the nomination by sweeping 46 states and accumulating the necessary electoral votes along the way.  The PACs cannot even buy this election even if they had enough money.  Having said this, the only way the PACs and kingmakers can throw this election is by assassinating Trump somewhere during the campaign before the convention.  Do not put this past them since plots have already been uncovered.  Remember when Trump was going to visit Israel a few months ago, and then cancelled at the last minute for no apparent reason?  Well, the reason is that the Russians picked up on a CIA Subgroup plot to take him out over there.  They discovered an encrypted laptop with all of Trump's itinerary and the Secret Service plans as well.  The PAC kingmakers are not going to go down quietly without a fight.  They can no longer take Trump down by legal means, and may resort to all sorts of nefarious means to do so, e.g. airplane crash, shot by an ex-El Chapo supporter, or pseudo ISIS hit.

Fox will try to smear Trump by posing questions he has no ready answers for.  How many of you all knew what theTriad was before Rubio piped up with the prepared answer?  There will be more of the same. Tomorrow, Trump needs to become a politician and provide reasonable answers even when there are none. If he acts presidential and refuses to engage in fights, he'll come out alright.  At any rate, the exit polls for tomorrow night's debate are already in: Trump won it by 69 % :)"

,1542,"Mar 2, 2016",rdixonshell,"@KarenConserv @rdixonshell The only problem with Rubio folding now is that he was the last establishment holdout.  I don't think Fox and other PACs will put their money on Cruz. He has never been considered a favorite from the beginning because of his lack of experience and his unpopularity in Congress.  The establishment are now stuck to choose a PACboy.  Could it be Kaisch? too little too late. Ben Carson? They already tore Ben apart weeks ago.  Their only hope now is to force a brokered convention and trot out Mitt Romney to give it a go again.  Their logic is that they only lost by a couple percent last election and can take Hillary easily.  Unfortunately, that scenario requires Trump's voters to come out to back Romney.  That simply is not going to happen.

What FOX never acknowledges is that OVER 50% of the Republican vote is being split between Cruz, Rubio, Kasich and Carson.  Those are four candidates who have very similar views on most issues.
Cruz has generally lead this group, followed closely by Rubio.  It is not unlikely that if the field were narrowed down to just Trump and Cruz.....CRUZ not Trump would be winning the lion's share of the states!!!

Assuming he is the Republican nominee, these Republicans will not vote for Trump in the general election.  Trump cannot win the general election without the voting support of the conservative socially responsible base of the current Republican party which is approximately 25% of the Republican vote or 15 million votes nationally.  Ironically, given Trumps threat to run as an independent, the conservative alternative will run on a third party ticket and split the historical Republican voting block.  The Democratic candidate will then win the election.  

The conservative arm of the party will sacrifice this election and then rebuild a new Conservative Constitutional party.  A Republican Trump ticket is doomed to lose in the general election by a wide margin.  The old GOP is finished!  Done!

That's not compromise. We are puzzled by all of the promises to stop this march while we watch the R's aiding in its continuation. We can only conclude they want the problem more than the solution. The problem allows them to feed off conservative anger with endless offerings of action in return for contributions. And this formula allows the money to flow into their coffers and then they retire with virtually nothing to show for their stay except their increased personal wealth.
We're on to you Republicans.

Georgia is much like many other key, high delegate count states demographically. Trump is just not going to do well there.

While the media has always had a major impact, but with the incredible impact of social media has driven it beyond reasonable bounds.  Media = make money, who cares what happens later; and this is true for both liberal and conservative media outlets. 
So many people think Trump is not part of the typical political process, but he is exactly the same - knowing how to manipulate people (especially through the media) to make people think he is more than he is.
Sanders is another media love-child - even though there is no change he could win the general election.  Clinton has enough dirt on people in her little black book that she so far has escaped federal prosecution, and the GOP focus has been on THEIR candidates - not the Dems. 
The stink is really going to hit the fan when the final candidates are nominated. To paraphrase Bette Davis - fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a long, bumpy ride!
Of course, the entire process completely eliminates the possibility of a third party candidate ever getting to the White House.  It would be truly interesting if a third party candidate won the popular vote by a huge majority, but the electoral vote is still stuck only being able to vote for a Dem or GOP!"

This is not a Washington decision, thank God, this is a decision of the people.  My opinion is the Republicans will be circumventing the people, if they do not rally for their candidate.  This is America, not some mid-east country where they just get rid of the people they don't want.  I find the Republican party un-American in their attitudes about this."

It very well could be an interesting debate, but one where the Fox moderators will do everything in their power to nail Trump with a buch of gotcha questions.

The GOP nomination math is pretty clear. Rubio and the other non-Trump candidates need to drop out in favor of Cruz.

1) A majority of GOP primary voters are casting their ballots for anti-establishment candidates (Trump, Cruz and Carson).

2) As an anti-establishment candidate, Cruz is substantially outperforming the rest of the non-Trump candidates.

3) If the other non-Trump candidates drop out, the heavy majority of their votes will go to Cruz, giving him a majority.

4) If Cruz drops out, most of his anti-establishment support goes to Trump, giving him a majority. Cruz staying in the race is arguably the only thing between Trump and the GOP nomination.

5) Cruz is tied with Clinton among registered voters using 2012 demograpahics which are not going to repeat in 2016. GOP voters have demonstrated that they are subtantially more enthusiastic about voting than the Democrats this cycle. This suggests that Cruz is actually leading Clinton among likely 2016 voters."

,3756,"Mar 2, 2016",QuestionMarkSmileyFace,@ILREDNK @QuestionMarkSmileyFace  The count I'm looking at is that Trump has 546 of 1168 (46.7%).

,3759,"Mar 2, 2016",RNMedic,@QuestionMarkSmileyFace  according to Webster dictionary..a majority is more than half of a number..so 1237 divided by 2 = 618.5

,3761,"Mar 2, 2016",ILREDNK,"@RNMedic @QuestionMarkSmileyFace BTW, the total delegates available in the GOP primaries is 2472, not 1237.  1237 is the number to gain the nomination."

Cruz won TX, getting a huge boost to his numbers.  However, where is his next big win?  Rubio maintaining his current pace and winning FL doesn't get him anywhere close to Trump, and the same goes for Kasich in OH.

For the national interest, as well as their own honor and reputation, they should drop out. Likewise, as long as both Cruz and Rubio stay in, neither has a realistic chance. But if one drops out, they'll probably win both the primary and the general as a president-VP ticket. This will serve their own self interest as well as the national interest. If Trump wins, they'll both be tarnished. In future elections, the electorate will be sick of them. If they form a ticket, they'll trade a most probable loss and oblivion for a probable victory and--for the VP--a good chance to win the presidency in the future. Looking ahead, it seems as if Cruz will win more popular votes and delegates than Rubio, so he should probably head the ticket."

,4656,"Mar 2, 2016",BeholdJesusStandsAtTheDoor,"@JamzBond Trump says in several interviews that he has never asked God for forgiveness. So does he even know God? That is between him and God, but really every time he talks on this it is obvious that he does not understand even the basics. "
,4657,"Mar 2, 2016",bucksy9996,@BeholdJesusStandsAtTheDoor @JamzBond which god? the one from the bible or the koran? the two books we know are false
,4658,"Mar 2, 2016",JamzBond,@bucksy9996 @BeholdJesusStandsAtTheDoor @JamzBond   Jesus is the Son of the Living God.  Go and read the Bible.  The Bible is God's Holy Word.  God will speak to you.  I know from experience. 
,4659,"Mar 2, 2016",JamzBond,@BeholdJesusStandsAtTheDoor @JamzBond I know all these things about Trump.  Aren't we all learning and growing in our walk with the Lord? 
,4660,"Mar 2, 2016",BeholdJesusStandsAtTheDoor,"@JamzBond @BeholdJesusStandsAtTheDoor Yes, I agree. But I cannot help being so overwhelmingly sad on WHY people are voting for Trump. He is not who he seems to be. Truly, I would not even be surprised if him and the Clintons cooked up this completely amazing plot years ago. He gave them lots of money and had them at his wedding.  I will be praying for the GOP candidate to know Jesus, just as I still pray for President Obama to know Jesus.  If Saul can change to Paul, anyone can change. But, I would not have elected Saul to any position of power before he became Paul. "
,4661,"Mar 2, 2016",JamzBond,"@BeholdJesusStandsAtTheDoor @JamzBond   Trump is exactly who he seems to be.  As a matter of fact, he is impulsive in his speech.  This Christian is voting for Trump because Trump has the courage of his convictions.  Trump will do something.  And Trump will enforce the Law;  Send them all back to Mexico.  Don't be afraid to enforce the law just because it seems harsh.  Send them back, or else we will not have any country.  & Please use common sense when dealing business with other countries.  The United States is not a door mat."

,4663,"Mar 2, 2016",bucksy9996,@JamzBond he surely is a christian. He took a picture with the bible

That isn't going to start more wars between the US and other countries?This isn't his stupid tv show. This isn't a school yard. This is our homes and families.

How much political time does he have under his belt? This is just a game to him. He's a bored man who wants to be the ruler of the world, well our country anyways. "

The world is at war with forces that want to destroy most of humanity, and that is all you can contribute? Making fun of a person's name?

As CEO he has to delegate and set a vision for what he wants and then have very qualified people execute that vision. If Trump  hires and nominates people like Ted Cruz, ( I also wish Ted would have won), then we'll effectively get what we were looking for anyway."
,5513,"Mar 2, 2016",mediacorrupt,"@TrustyScout Cruz is hated by his own party more than they hate Trump. Cruz is not even eligible to hold that office. He even knows it but he figures no one with actual standing to challenge it in the courts will do anything. He seen how they did nothing with Obama so he figured he can get away with it to. Why not. But the fact remains many do know he's not and they will not support him for that very reason.

The problem is the electorate is split almost down the middle. They are showing up to support him with votes or to keep him out by voting against him. Unfortunately, those voting against him are splitting their votes among the 4 other candidates. If it were only Rubio or Cruz I dare say the leader may very well be different. So think about it - what will happen if the final result of the convention results in a third party run. It is obvious, Hillary or some other democrat (assuming Hillary is indicted) wins the White House. Trump isn't my guy but at this point I would say he needs to get enough delegates out of the primaries to be assured the nomination or the convention will be a sham, someone else will be nominated. Trump will run as a third party candidate, splitting the Republican vote and handing the election to the democrats"

He discredits everybody who disagrees with him. He’s insulting. He discriminates against everybody.”
Weiss continued: “Sooner or later, you know what happens in a case like this? That’s how Weimar Germany went to h e l l, because when H i t l e r came in, if somebody disagreed with him — guess what — he put them in prison or he had them shot or he opened the concentration camp.”

,5644,"Mar 2, 2016",dansama,@desert21 @dansama  GOD'S wrath is coming. You think I care that?
,5645,"Mar 2, 2016",hazmatsuit,"Trump needs most is his cult followers to kiss his ***. And they do it! Gladly. 

I can't wait till this November when his soufflé toupee becomes just an obscene footnote to history."
,5646,"Mar 2, 2016",gansman,@hazmatsuit Or may be we will win and Trump will make America great again. You and your kind would hate that I guess
,5647,"Mar 2, 2016",jimdep,"The TRUTH spoken by Mr. Trump beats a sleazy, lying politician any day ! God bless you Trump. TRUMP or BUST"

We will finally have a real president again when Trump takes the White House. "
,5650,"Mar 2, 2016",dansama,@jimdep @onetrickmonkey  Right! Just watch Trump 'revise' the Constitution. Trump is also pretty fast with a pen and a phone.
,5651,"Mar 2, 2016",onetrickmonkey,Gov Rick Scott DID ENDORSE Trump & Trump won 8 states not 7......
,5652,"Mar 2, 2016",Megisis324,"Actually you are wrong on both. Trump 7 states, Cruz 3 states, Rubio 1 state. No endorsement from Rick Scott"
,5653,"Mar 2, 2016",mako zero,how much must the cons hate their own party to pave the way to the wh for clinton. a reality tv-star billionair hijacked the gop with simple slogans for the simple minded and everyone stand near by and watched it. from this fatal blow the gop will need a long time to recover. but at the end it’s good and easy money for fox.
,5654,"Mar 2, 2016",JoeFarmer,"@mako zero  A simple slogan like ""hope and change""???  The ""hope"" turned out to be despair and the ""change"" turned out to be Marxism/communism and totalitarian rule by decree."
,5655,"Mar 2, 2016",TLute52,"Clinton is garbage. Any of the top 3 would shove her in the dumpster, where she belongs."
,5656,"Mar 2, 2016",TrishaDoherty,"Trump 2016!

back Up in Obama's *** with the resurrection"
,5657,"Mar 2, 2016",sanestsight,yeah a real unifier.  Its easy to unify when you have no real plan or positions.  This is a man who has gotten the backing of both white supremacist David Duke and Black supremacist nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.  When all the crazies at both ends support the same guy its time to worry
,5658,"Mar 2, 2016",briansadowski,TRUMP WINS LANDSLIDE!!!!!
