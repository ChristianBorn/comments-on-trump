;1;04.03.2016;Jason Segedy;Super delegates have not had their vote yet, very irresponsible thing for Pelosi to say. It is actually currently Clinton-595 to Bernie 405, and still many states to go;;
;2;04.03.2016;Rick Ganan;First, Pelosi decries the superdelegate system. Then she marvels at Hillary Clinton's impressive lead in pledged delegates! What a hypocrite!;;
;3;04.03.2016;classicwoodie;The peoples choice is not being shown if Super-delegates can crash the Party!;;
;4;04.03.2016;Laura Knight-Jadczyk;"The ""superdelegate"" system is a trick of the wealthy elite.  It should be abolished.";;
;5;04.03.2016;Robin Banks;Bernie has the Merit for the job, the others do not.;;
;6;04.03.2016;John Normanton;US politics are as corrupt as Zimbabwe's.;;
;7;04.03.2016;Chuck Lee;this is a fake way to get bernie voters to back clinton - not gonna work - people are smarter than that. bernie supporters see clearly that hilhagary is taking his platform so she can win but will do nothing just like obomber - all fakes. all the democratic oligarchs have already said they are backing clinton. bernie needs an overwhelming majority to shut them up,;;
;8;04.03.2016;Norman Allen;There is only one candidate whose deeds seems to conform to his words: Sanders.  The rest seems to belong to Einstein's school of madness: doing the same, expecting different results.  The establishment's two party system seem to stack the cards against sanity for the insanity imposed by the 1% who buys power and concentrates wealth/power to the detriment of the 99%.  It remains to be seen if the insanity will continue with the political process that was set up for the  pre-industrial USA and which is hijacked by the 1%.;;
;9;04.03.2016;heu2016;Bernie is the better choice ! This election process is stealing his chance! Such bs;;
;10;04.03.2016;heu2016;That is one thing I agree with Nancy  on. I think that they should remove all super delegates ! Let the people decide!  Super delegates just lead to corruption and special deals ..;;

;17;10.03.2016;Scott Watkins;Bernie has received enough attention that I think he could tell the Democratic party to go to hell and run a successful independent campaign at this point. And if he loses the Democratic nomination he should. It's high time we brought this 2 party franchise to a halt.;Scott Watkins;"So Hickenlooper sees the Colorado votes as ""enthusiasm"" for Bernie, but still chooses Clinton.

He's not proud of it but you use every tool to fix a problem. The Republicans created a disenfranchised constituency and while most of them are good people some of them are xenophobic and/or raciest. These are the Republicans who nominate candidates. Donald is in this to win and he will come back to center just like all candidates do in the general election. Go watch his TV show and see how he has praised women and people of diversity long before he was running for POTUS. One of these two parties need to GO in order to save the country.

ThompsonPolitics today is not about Republicans and Democrats.Nor is it about healthcare, abortion, higher taxes, free college tuition, or any of the other buzzwords that have become campaign slogans for individuals who have mastered the art of telling Americans exactly what they want to hear.Politics today is about one thing and one thing only: maintaining the status quo between the Controllers (the politicians, the bureaucrats, and the corporate elite) and the Controlled (the taxpayers).Hillary will not save the nation. Nor will Bernie, Trump, Rubio, or Cruz.The only ones who can save the nation are “we the people,” and yet the American people remain eager to be persuaded that a new president in the White House can solve the problems that plague us.No matter who wins this next presidential election, you can rest assured that the new boss will be the same as the old boss, and we—the permanent underclass in America—will continue to be forced to march in lockstep with the police state in all matters, public and private. Perhaps the most troubling fact of all is this: we have handed over control of our government and our lives to faceless bureaucrats who view us as little more than cattle to be bred, branded, butchered, and sold for profit.If there is to be any hope of restoring our freedoms and reclaiming control over our government, it will rest not with the politicians but with the people themselves.When all is said and done, each American will have to decide for themselves whether they prefer dangerous freedom to peaceful slavery. One thing is for sure: the reassurance ritual of voting is not going to advance freedom one iota. Wake up Americans we are headed for modern day slavery. The sad fact is no one in this country cares anymore which is depressing.;;
