So when they Graduate they can get a part time minimum wage job to try and live off of.  So the Democratic Economic Cycle is Complete. the Poor stay Poor,  the children of middle class parents become poor and the Wall Street CEO's get richer;neutral

Because the game is rigged by the GOP AND DEMS. The only reason Trump is winning is because A. he is a celebrity, B. he's obnoxiously funny, and C. people want to watch the world burn. The underlying argument here is what good will come of this. Breaking down the establishment and political game is what needs to happen.;neg

It has been going on since 2008. Restoring Republicans back to ver. 1.0 from ver. 2.0 where evangelicals and neocons took over the party. In 2012, there was a major shake up with the Romney establishment vs. Paul's delegates. It forced a brokered convention and some shady stuff went down where the establishment (Boehner/Preibus) forced rules down the throat of the party. Google ""Boehner and the ayes have it"" and watch the youtube video. It is very depressing, but shows you the stronghold the establishment has on the party. The Trump vote is taking things out of the hand of the establishment. If Trump doesn't get enough delegates though, and it goes to brokered convention again, watch out. They will try to push Rubio as the candidate with more shady rules.";neg

There are also plenty of individuals who are sick of how ""political correctness"" keeps us from addressing issues because people are taking offense when we try to define the problem.

And even to this day it's much more difficult for African Americans to get bank loans or any kind of financial aid to start any kind of business. Which is why African American families and communities struggle to get out of poverty even to this day.  While white families and communities have had hundreds of years to collect wealth African Americans have had at best 40 years.And it's absolutely insane for you to question anyone's accusation of racism when you yourself approach the conversation in such an aggressive manner.;neutral

Stiffed his employees and stiffed his suppliers. The problem is his notions so far have been actually calculated by people with calulators  It would explode the debt.  The increased size of the military and his promised wall and his plans would add anywhere from a trillion to a trillion and a half in expenditure annually while he plans to cut the taxes for the very well off a lot and a little for everyone else.  That adds up to increased debt, not less. You like that he has stiffed his suppliers and employees rather than carefully figuring out ahead of time how to do something.  Remind me never to invest in anything you put together as a business.  No it is not called grasping reality  it is called not thinking it out and leaving others to pick up the pieces at the bottom.;neg

Either all growth should stop or slow down, or all boats should rise on the same tide.  If you want a reason it's free trade and the elimination of tariffs which disproportionately benefits the rich at the expense of the working class whose jobs are shifted to the lowest cost jurisdiction.  Both Trump and Sanders are talking about bringing jobs back to America and the implication behind that is, of course, going back on some of the free trade agreements made in recent decades.  We'll all pay more for T-shirts and underwear, but there will be millions more jobs in the US and who cares what it does to China, India and Mexico.;neutral

Here's how it is going to work.   The disparity is going to keep growing.  Now that the spotlight is shining on the issue it will stay in the news and people will have stronger and stronger reactions to it if nothing is done to at least make it appear that the system is ""fair"".  The result will be the election of someone like a Trump or a Sanders on a platform of protectionism and high taxes on the top 1% and passive income.  When things get out of balance they tend to end up getting put back into balance one way or another.   When Adam Smith thinks that management should earn about 20 times what an average employee earns but the ratio is now 300 times and the SEC is even going to make public companies start reporting the spread you know the gig is up.  If you're one of those guys whose been lining your pockets then better start stuffing some cash into a Swiss bank account while you still can.";neg

Why on earth would we not want a wall along the border of a country that is one of the largest producers of Heroin. Do you know if there were vast numbers of opium producing poppy fields growing in the US that the Government would  step in and eradicate them. You would not be able to see through the smoke. The Mexican government has done nothing to help with the Heroin epidemic in this country and if they have it is not enough.;neutral

Before and immediately after WWII the US was very rational including staying out of Europe's wars for as long as possible, leaving the Emperor of Japan in place after WWII to maintain stability in the country, allowing former N a z i's to continue in administrative roles in Germany after WWII since there were no other choices (think of the mistake we made in Iraq!), and the Marshall Plan, etc.   There were a lot of smart moves made back in the day.  Not so much anymore.;neutral

I'm still not sure that the media and the establishment get it.   The American people truly and deeply hate them and what they stand for so if they are against something the reaction will be to support it.   The best way to crater Trump is to have the GOP establishment endorse him and for him to bask in that support.   That'll push a lot of his support over to Cruz.;pos
